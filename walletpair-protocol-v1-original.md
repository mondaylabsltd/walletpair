# WalletPair Protocol v1

Status: Draft

WalletPair Protocol is a minimal, permissionless two-party channel protocol for
connecting dApps and wallets.

In WebSocket mode, a relay server is still needed
to route messages between the two parties. However, unlike protocols that depend
on a single vendor's infrastructure, WalletPair allows anyone to deploy their
own relay — dApp developers can run a dedicated relay server, and the wallet can
switch between relays freely.In Bluetooth mode, no relay is needed at all. No
registration, API key, or vendor lock-in is required in either case.

The channel is created by the dApp. The wallet joins that channel. After a
cryptographic handshake, the dApp can send requests and the wallet can send
responses or events.

Intended flow:

1. DApp creates a channel and generates a pairing URI (QR code).
2. Wallet scans QR code or opens deep link.
3. Wallet derives the shared secret and session fingerprint, asks user
   to confirm the fingerprint matches the dApp's display.
4. User confirms on wallet. Wallet sends join with its public key and
   capabilities.
5. DApp verifies sealed_join and auto-accepts. Channel is now connected
   and encrypted.
6. DApp sends requests. Wallet sends responses and events.

WalletPair is transport independent. The same protocol messages can run over
WebSocket Relay, Bluetooth, local TCP, or another ordered bidirectional
transport.

`dapp` and `wallet` are application roles. They do not have to match lower
level transport roles such as Bluetooth central/peripheral or TCP client/server.

## 1. Scope

WalletPair defines:

- channel creation and pairing URI
- key exchange and end-to-end encryption
- capability negotiation
- session fingerprint and user confirmation on wallet side
- request and response
- wallet events
- heartbeat
- close and reconnect semantics

WalletPair does not define:

- wallet logic or signing logic
- business payload schema
- specific service method registry
- relay cluster architecture or storage backend

Those belong to upper-layer protocols or deployment configurations.

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Zero registration.** A relay must not require API keys, project IDs, or
   account signup. Any developer can deploy a relay and use it immediately.
2. **Self-hostable.** The relay is a lightweight message router with only
   ephemeral in-memory state. No persistent storage is required. A single
   binary or container is all that is needed.
3. **Relay-blind.** All request parameters, response results, and event data
   are end-to-end encrypted. The relay sees only routing metadata.
4. **Transport independent.** The protocol works over any ordered bidirectional
   transport.
5. **Simple.** The full protocol fits in one document. Implementation should
   take days, not weeks.

## 3. Roles

Each channel has exactly two roles.

### DApp

The dApp creates the channel, accepts or rejects the wallet, and calls
wallet methods. To reject a wallet, the dApp sends `close` with an
appropriate reason (e.g., `user_rejected` or `unsupported_capability`).
There is no separate reject message.

The dApp may send:

```text
create
accept
req
ping
pong
close          (also used to reject a wallet join request)
```

### Wallet

The wallet joins an existing channel, handles requests, and may push events.

The wallet may send:

```text
join
res
evt
ping
pong
close
```

### Transport Adapter

The transport adapter (relay, Bluetooth stack, etc.) is not a peer. It
acts as the channel state manager: when the dApp calls `create`, the
adapter replies with `ready.waiting`; when the wallet calls `join` and
the dApp sends `accept`, the adapter sends `ready.connected` to both
sides.

The adapter may send:

```text
ready          (channel state notification)
terminate      (adapter-initiated channel termination)
```

Neither the dApp nor the wallet sends `ready` or `terminate`. Adapter
messages use `from` = `"_adapter"` (a reserved identifier, not a
cryptographic key). Peers MUST reject any peer-sent message where
`from` equals `"_adapter"`.

The wallet does not create channels. The dApp does not send events.

## 4. Identifiers

### Channel ID

Field: `ch`

The channel ID identifies one pending or connected channel. It must be a
random 32-byte value encoded as hex (64 characters).

### Sender Identity

Field: `from`

The `from` field is present in **every** message and identifies the sender:

- **Peer-sent messages** (`create`, `join`, `accept`, `req`, `res`,
  `evt`, `ping`, `pong`, `close`): `from` is the sender's X25519 public
  key, encoded as base64url (no padding). This binds identity to
  cryptographic material and prevents impersonation.
- **Adapter-sent messages** (`ready`, `terminate`): `from` is the
  reserved string `"_adapter"`. This is not a cryptographic key. Peers
  MUST treat `"_adapter"` as a reserved value and MUST reject any
  peer-sent message where `from` equals `"_adapter"`.

### Request ID

Field: `id`

The dApp generates a unique request ID for every `req`. The wallet must copy
the same `id` into the matching `res`. The request ID should be a UUID v4 or
another random string with sufficient entropy to avoid collisions.

## 5. Message Format

Every WalletPair message is one JSON object with a fixed envelope and a
type-specific body.

### 5.1 Envelope

All messages share the same top-level envelope fields:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "message_type",
  "ch": "channel-id",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-pubkey-or-_adapter",
  "body": { }
}
```

| Field  | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `v`    | yes | Protocol version. Must be `1`. |
| `t`    | yes | Message type. |
| `ch`   | yes | Channel ID (hex, 64 chars). |
| `ts`   | yes | Sender timestamp in milliseconds (Unix epoch). Informational only (see below). |
| `from` | yes | Sender identity. X25519 public key (base64url) for peer messages, `"_adapter"` for adapter messages. |
| `body` | yes | Type-specific payload. Schema determined by `t`. |

**`ts` validation.** The `ts` field is the sender's local wall-clock time
and is informational. Receivers MUST NOT reject messages solely based on
`ts`. Clock skew between peers is expected. Implementations MAY use `ts`
for display, logging, or request-timeout heuristics, but MUST NOT use it
as a security-critical input (e.g., replay detection relies on sequence
counters, not timestamps). The relay MAY reject messages with `ts` that
deviates more than 5 minutes from server time as a protocol-error
heuristic, but this is an availability measure, not a security boundary.

### 5.2 Body Schemas

Each message type defines its own `body` schema. **All fields listed are
required.** Use `null` when the value is not applicable (e.g., `remote`
is `null` when state is `waiting`).

| `t` | `body` fields |
|-----|---------------|
| `create` | `meta` |
| `join` | `sealed_join` |
| `accept` | `target` |
| `ready` | `state`, `role`, `self`, `remote`, `reconnect` |
| `req` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `res` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `evt` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `ping` | (empty object) |
| `pong` | (empty object) |
| `close` | `reason` |
| `terminate` | `reason` |

Body field descriptions:

| Field | In `body` of | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `meta` | `create` | Display metadata object (`name`, `description`, `url`, `icon`). All fields required. See §9.2. |
| `sealed_join` | `join` | Encrypted capabilities and metadata, base64url. See Section 7.5. `null` on reconnect. |
| `target` | `accept` | Target peer ID (wallet public key, base64url). |
| `state` | `ready` | `"waiting"` or `"connected"`. |
| `role` | `ready` | Local role: `"dapp"` or `"wallet"`. |
| `self` | `ready` | Local peer ID (base64url public key). |
| `remote` | `ready` | Remote peer ID (base64url public key). `null` when `state` is `"waiting"`. |
| `reconnect` | `ready` | Boolean. `true` when this `ready` is the result of a reconnect, `false` on initial pairing. |
| `id` | `req`, `res`, `evt` | Request or event ID. |
| `sealed` | `req`, `res`, `evt` | Encrypted payload, base64url. See Section 7.4. |
| `reason` | `close`, `terminate` | Close or termination reason. |

### 5.3 Sealed Payload Content

The `sealed` field contains encrypted JSON. The real method or event name
is carried **inside** the encrypted payload, never on the wire in
plaintext. The decrypted content depends on the message type:

| Message type | Decrypted `sealed` content |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `req` | `{ "_method": "<method_name>", ...params }` |
| `res` (success) | `{ "_ok": true, "_result": <result> }` |
| `res` (error) | `{ "_ok": false, "code": "<error_code>", "message": "<description>" }` |
| `evt` | `{ "_event": "<event_name>", ...data }` |

The `_method` and `_event` fields are required. If missing after
decryption, the receiver MUST reject with `invalid_params`. The `_ok`
field is required in all `res` payloads. If missing after decryption,
the receiver MUST reject with `protocol_error`.

The `_result` field carries the response value. It may be any JSON
value: an object (e.g., `{ "txHash": "0x..." }`), `null`, or a
primitive. When the result is logically empty, use `{ "_ok": true,
"_result": null }`.

When the payload is logically empty, encrypt `{ "_method": "<name>" }`
(for req) or `{ "_event": "<name>" }` (for evt).
Every `req`, `res`, and `evt` MUST carry a `sealed` field — a message
without `sealed` after `ready.connected` MUST be rejected.

Note: The plaintext fields `params`, `result`, `error`, and `data` never
appear on the wire. Their content is encrypted into the `sealed` field.
The success/failure status of a response is also inside the encrypted
payload (the `_ok` field), not visible to the relay.
The receiver decrypts `sealed` to recover the original JSON value. See
Section 7.4 for encryption details.

## 6. Message Types

WalletPair v1 has eleven message types:

Peer-sent messages:

```text
create    (dApp -> adapter)           channel creation
join      (wallet -> dApp)            wallet joins channel
accept    (dApp -> wallet)            dApp accepts wallet
req       (dApp -> wallet)            encrypted request
res       (wallet -> dApp)            encrypted response
evt       (wallet -> dApp)            encrypted event
ping      (either peer -> peer)       heartbeat
pong      (either peer -> peer)       heartbeat reply
close     (either peer -> peer)       peer-initiated close or reject
```

Adapter-sent messages:

```text
ready     (adapter -> peer)           channel state notification
terminate (adapter -> peer)           adapter-initiated termination
```

There is no separate `error` message. Request errors are indicated by
`_ok = false` inside the encrypted `res` payload. Channel errors and
rejection use `close`. Adapter-initiated shutdown uses `terminate`.

## 7. Key Exchange and Encryption

### 7.1 Key Exchange

Both peers generate an ephemeral X25519 key pair per channel.

The dApp includes its public key in `create`. The wallet includes its public
key in `join`. After both keys are exchanged, each side computes the shared
secret using X25519 Diffie-Hellman.

Timeline:

1. The wallet obtains the dApp's public key from the pairing URI.
2. The wallet sends `join` with its own public key.
3. The dApp receives `join` and obtains the wallet's public key.
4. Both sides can now independently derive the root key and, after `join`,
   the direction-specific traffic keys.

### 7.2 Shared Secret and Directional Key Derivation

```text
shared_secret = X25519(local_private_key, remote_public_key)
root_key      = HKDF-SHA256(
                  ikm  = shared_secret,
                  salt = channel_id_bytes,   // 32 bytes, decoded from hex
                  info = "walletpair-v1 root"
                )[0:32]                      // 32 bytes output
```

After the wallet sends `join`, both peers construct the same handshake
transcript:

```text
transcript_hash = SHA256(
  "walletpair-v1-transcript" ||
  channel_id_bytes ||
  lp(dapp_pubkey_base64url) ||
  lp(wallet_pubkey_base64url) ||
  lp(canonical_json(capabilities or null)) ||   // from decrypted sealed_join
  lp(canonical_json(meta or null)) ||            // from decrypted sealed_join
  lp(dapp_name_from_pairing_uri or "")
)
```

`canonical_json` is UTF-8 JSON with the following deterministic rules,
which are compatible with [RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme,
JCS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785). Implementations MAY use
a conforming RFC 8785 library directly. All object keys in this protocol
are ASCII; non-ASCII keys are reserved for future versions.

1. **Object keys** are sorted lexicographically by their UTF-8 byte
   representation (not by Unicode code point — in practice these are
   identical for ASCII keys used in this protocol).
2. **No insignificant whitespace** — no spaces after `:` or `,`, no
   newlines or indentation.
3. **`undefined`** is represented as `null`.
4. **Numbers** use the shortest decimal representation with no trailing
   zeroes (e.g., `1` not `1.0`, `0` not `0.0`). No leading zeroes. No
   `+` prefix. Negative zero is serialized as `0`.
5. **Strings** use `\uXXXX` escaping only for control characters
   (U+0000–U+001F). Printable characters including non-ASCII Unicode
   are serialized as literal UTF-8, not escaped. The mandatory JSON
   escapes (`\"`, `\\`, `\/`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`) use the
   short form. Forward slash `/` MUST NOT be escaped.
6. **`null`**, **`true`**, **`false`** use their literal JSON forms.
7. Sorting is recursive: nested objects also have their keys sorted.

**Canonical JSON test vectors:**

```text
Input:  { "methods": ["wallet_signTransaction", "wallet_signMessage"],
          "events": ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"],
          "chains": ["eip155:1", "eip155:137"] }

canonical_json output (UTF-8 bytes):
{"chains":["eip155:1","eip155:137"],"events":["accountsChanged","chainChanged"],"methods":["wallet_signTransaction","wallet_signMessage"]}

SHA-256 of above bytes:
4da366e2aae26b47b3d90fff52410752348733350ce2525dce7d64510f571333
```

```text
Input:  null
canonical_json output: null
```

```text
Input:  { "name": "MyWallet" }
canonical_json output: {"name":"MyWallet"}
```

Implementations MUST verify their canonical JSON output matches these test
vectors byte-for-byte before deployment. See also Appendix A for a complete
end-to-end test vector including canonical JSON in the transcript hash.

The traffic keys are direction-specific:

```text
dapp_to_wallet_key = HKDF-SHA256(
                       ikm  = root_key,
                       salt = transcript_hash,
                       info = "walletpair-v1 dapp-to-wallet"
                     )[0:32]

wallet_to_dapp_key = HKDF-SHA256(
                       ikm  = root_key,
                       salt = transcript_hash,
                       info = "walletpair-v1 wallet-to-dapp"
                     )[0:32]
```

The same key MUST NOT be used in both directions. `req` messages use
`dapp_to_wallet_key`; `res` and `evt` messages use `wallet_to_dapp_key`.
If a relay tampers with the wallet public key, capabilities, wallet
metadata, or dApp name visible to one peer, the peers derive different
traffic keys and the channel becomes cryptographically non-functional
(AEAD decryption fails on both sides).

For private handshake (Section 7.5), the wallet encrypts capabilities
and metadata before sending `join`. This uses a separate key derived
from the root key:

```text
join_encryption_key = HKDF-SHA256(
                        ikm  = root_key,
                        salt = channel_id_bytes,
                        info = "walletpair-v1 join-encryption"
                      )[0:32]
```

This key is available to both peers at `join` time because the wallet
knows the dApp public key from the pairing URI and can compute the
shared secret and root key before sending `join`. The dApp computes the
same key after receiving the wallet's public key in `join`.

### 7.3 Session Fingerprint

Both sides independently derive a 4-digit session fingerprint from the
channel ID and dApp public key. This fingerprint is used for the wallet
user to verify they are connecting to the correct dApp.

```text
fp_bytes     = SHA256(
                 "walletpair-v1-session-fingerprint" ||
                 channel_id_bytes ||
                 dapp_pubkey_bytes
               )[0:4]                            // first 4 bytes
fp_uint32    = big-endian uint32(fp_bytes)
fingerprint  = fp_uint32 mod 10000               // zero-pad to 4 digits
```

Both the dApp and the wallet can compute this fingerprint **independently
and simultaneously** — no message exchange is needed. The dApp knows its
own public key and channel ID. The wallet knows both from the pairing URI.

**Display and confirmation flow:**

1. The dApp displays the fingerprint alongside the QR code (e.g.,
   "Session: 4821").
2. The wallet scans the QR code, computes the same fingerprint, and
   displays it in the connection confirmation dialog (e.g., "Connect to
   MyDApp? Session: 4821").
3. The user verifies the fingerprint matches the dApp's display and
   confirms. The wallet sends `join`.
4. The dApp auto-accepts after verifying `sealed_join`.

This one-time confirmation protects the wallet user against connecting
to a malicious dApp in deep link scenarios, where a software intermediary
could substitute the dApp's public key. In QR code scenarios the optical
channel already prevents key substitution, but the fingerprint provides
defense-in-depth at no additional UX cost (the user is already looking
at the dApp screen to scan the QR code).

### 7.4 Message Encryption

After `ready.connected`, payload fields must be encrypted into the
`body.sealed` field. See §5.3 for the mapping between message types and
their encrypted content.

Encryption uses ChaCha20-Poly1305 with the direction-specific traffic key:

```text
nonce    = HMAC-SHA256(traffic_key, seq_bytes)[0:12]   // first 12 bytes
aad      = concat(channel_id_bytes, aad_header)
sealed   = AEAD_encrypt(traffic_key, nonce, plaintext_json_utf8, aad)
envelope = base64url_no_pad(seq_bytes || ciphertext || tag)
```

The `aad_header` authenticates the plaintext envelope fields to prevent a
compromised relay from tampering with routing metadata. It uses
length-prefixed encoding to avoid delimiter ambiguity:

```text
lp(s) = uint16_be(byte_length(utf8(s))) || utf8(s)

req:  aad_header = 0x01 || lp(from) || lp(id)
res:  aad_header = 0x02 || lp(from) || lp(id)
evt:  aad_header = 0x03 || lp(from) || lp(id)
```

The leading type byte doubles as a `t`+`v` binding (type bytes `0x01`-`0x03`
are defined for protocol version 1 only). The `ch` field is already bound
via `channel_id_bytes` in the AAD prefix.

The `lp()` function uses a 2-byte length prefix (uint16_be), supporting
field UTF-8 byte lengths up to 65535. If any field exceeds 65535 UTF-8
bytes, the sender MUST reject the message before encryption. In practice,
all AAD fields (`from`, `id`) are short strings well within this limit.

The leading type byte (`0x01`/`0x02`/`0x03`) and length-prefixed fields
ensure unambiguous parsing regardless of field content. If a relay
modifies any plaintext field (`from`, `id`), AEAD decryption will fail.

**AAD test vector** (for cross-implementation verification):

```text
Given:  ch = "aa" repeated 32 times (64 hex chars)
        type = req (0x01)
        from = "dGVzdA" (base64url of "test")
        id   = "req-1"

aad_header = 01                       (type byte)
           | 0006 6447567A6441       (lp("dGVzdA") = 6 bytes)
           | 0005 7265712D31         (lp("req-1") = 5 bytes)
aad = channel_id_bytes || aad_header
```

Where `seq_bytes` is a 4-byte big-endian sequence number. Each peer maintains
its own send counter, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each message
that carries a `sealed` field.

The receiver tracks the highest accepted sequence number from the remote peer
(initially -1, meaning no message received yet). On receiving a message with
`sealed`, the receiver reads the 4-byte sequence prefix and must reject the
message if the sequence number is not strictly greater than the last accepted
value. After accepting, the receiver updates its tracking value.

During normal operation on an ordered transport, sequence numbers will arrive
consecutively (0, 1, 2, ...). After a reconnect, there may be gaps due to
in-flight messages lost during the transport drop; these gaps are expected and
valid (see Section 14).

Sequence counters are persisted across reconnects and never reset.

If a peer's send sequence counter reaches `2^31` (2,147,483,648), the
peer MUST close the channel with reason `normal` and require a fresh
pairing. This prevents nonce exhaustion. At typical usage rates (one
message per second), this limit allows ~68 years of continuous use per
session, so it should never be reached in practice. Implementations MUST
still handle this case to prevent nonce reuse if a counter is corrupted.

Example `req` with encrypted params:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "req",
  "ch": "aabb...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "req-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-of-seq-ciphertext-tag"
  }
}
```

Method and event names are never on the wire. They exist only inside the
encrypted `sealed` payload (see §5.3). The relay cannot determine what
operations are being performed.

### 7.5 Encrypted Join (sealed_join)

The `join` message always encrypts capabilities and metadata in the
`body.sealed_join` field. The relay cannot read the wallet's
capabilities, supported chains, methods, or identity.

#### Encryption

The wallet encrypts its capabilities and metadata using the
`join_encryption_key` derived in Section 7.2:

```text
join_plaintext = canonical_json({
  "capabilities": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }
})

join_nonce     = random_96_bits()
join_aad       = channel_id_bytes || 0x04   // type byte 0x04 = sealed_join
sealed_join    = AEAD_encrypt(join_encryption_key, join_nonce, join_plaintext, join_aad)
envelope       = base64url_no_pad(join_nonce || sealed_join_ciphertext || tag)
```

The wallet MUST generate a fresh uniformly random 96-bit nonce for every
`sealed_join` encryption. The dApp MUST parse the first 12 bytes of the
decoded envelope as `join_nonce` and reject envelopes shorter than
`12 + 16` bytes.

The type byte `0x04` is reserved for `sealed_join` in protocol
version 1.

**Retry behavior.** If the wallet needs to retry `join` (e.g., no
`ready` received due to network timeout), it MUST re-encrypt
`sealed_join` with a fresh random nonce. The wallet MUST NOT change
the capabilities or metadata between retries on the same channel —
changing them would cause a transcript hash mismatch if the dApp
already processed an earlier `join`.

#### Wire format

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "join",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": "base64url-encrypted-capabilities-and-meta"
  }
}
```

#### DApp processing

Upon receiving a `join`:

1. The dApp computes `shared_secret`, `root_key`, and
   `join_encryption_key` using the wallet's public key from `from`.
2. The dApp decrypts `body.sealed_join` to recover `capabilities` and
   `meta`.
3. If decryption fails, the dApp MUST close with `decryption_failed`.
4. The dApp uses the decrypted `capabilities` and `meta` for all
   subsequent operations (transcript hash, traffic key derivation,
   accept/reject decision).

The transcript hash (Section 7.2) is computed over the **decrypted**
capabilities and meta values. Both peers produce identical transcript
hashes because they decrypt the same `sealed_join` content.

#### Relay transparency

The relay does not need to understand `sealed_join`. It forwards the
`join` message to the dApp as an opaque JSON object. The relay cannot
read capabilities, meta, supported chains, or wallet type.

## 8. Capability Negotiation

The wallet declares its capabilities inside the encrypted `sealed_join`
field of the `join` message (see §7.5). The decrypted content is:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "methods": [
      "wallet_signTransaction",
      "wallet_signMessage",
      "wallet_sendTransaction",
      "wallet_getAccounts"
    ],
    "events": [
      "accountsChanged",
      "chainChanged"
    ],
    "chains": [
      "eip155:1",
      "eip155:137",
      "solana:mainnet"
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "name": "MyWallet",
    "description": "A multi-chain wallet",
    "url": "https://mywallet.app",
    "icon": "https://mywallet.app/icon.png"
  }
}
```

The dApp decrypts `sealed_join`, inspects `capabilities` before calling
`accept`. If the wallet does
not support a required chain or method, the dApp may `close` with
`unsupported_capability`.

**Wallet `meta` fields:**

| Field         | Required | Description                         |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | Wallet display name.                |
| `description` | yes      | Short description of the wallet.    |
| `url`         | yes      | Wallet official website URL.        |
| `icon`        | yes      | Wallet icon URL. MUST be `https:`.  |

Wallet `meta` is encrypted inside `sealed_join` and invisible to the
relay.

Capability fields:

| Field       | Type     | Description                                      |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `methods` | string[] | Methods authorized for this session.             |
| `events`  | string[] | Event types the wallet may push in this session. |
| `chains`  | string[] | CAIP-2 chains authorized for this session.       |

All three fields are required in `capabilities`. An empty array means the
wallet explicitly supports none of that category.

The wallet SHOULD include a `version` field in `capabilities` to declare
the sub-protocol versions it supports:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "methods": [...],
    "events": [...],
    "chains": [...],
    "version": {
      "evm": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The `version` object maps sub-protocol namespace strings to integer version
numbers. This allows the dApp to verify sub-protocol compatibility before
`accept`. If the dApp requires a sub-protocol version the wallet does not
declare, the dApp SHOULD `close` with `unsupported_capability`. If
`version` is absent, the dApp MUST assume version 1 for all declared chain
namespaces (backward compatible with implementations that predate this
field).

The `capabilities` in the `join` message represents the **granted session
scope** — the full set of methods, events, and chains the wallet
authorizes for this session. The wallet decides what to grant based on
its own capabilities and user confirmation. The dApp can inspect the
granted `capabilities` to know exactly what is available and adapt its
behavior accordingly (e.g., use `wallet_signTransaction` + self-broadcast
if `wallet_sendTransaction` is not granted).

After `ready.connected`, the dApp calls `wallet_getAccounts` to discover
the approved accounts. The combination of `capabilities` from the
decrypted `sealed_join` (methods, chains) and the `wallet_getAccounts`
response (accounts) constitutes the
complete approved session scope.

Account authorization is intentionally not placed in the plaintext `join`
message. Wallets that expose account-based methods MUST select or confirm the
session's account set during pairing, then reveal it only through encrypted
upper-layer methods such as `wallet_getAccounts`.

### 8.1 Session Scope Negotiation

The pairing URI `methods` and `chains` fields declare the dApp's
**minimum requirements** — the capabilities the dApp needs to function.
The wallet's `capabilities` in `join` declares the **granted scope** —
what the wallet actually authorizes for this session.

#### Wallet side

When the pairing URI includes `methods` and/or `chains`:

1. The wallet MUST check that it can satisfy the dApp's requirements.
   If the wallet cannot provide any of the required methods or chains,
   it SHOULD warn the user before proceeding (e.g., "This dApp requires
   wallet_sendTransaction, but this wallet can only sign transactions").
2. The wallet MAY grant additional methods or chains beyond what the
   dApp requested. For example, a wallet that supports both
   `wallet_signTransaction` and `wallet_signMessage` may grant both
   even if the dApp only requested `wallet_signTransaction`.
3. The wallet MUST display the granted scope to the user for
   confirmation before sending `join`.

When the pairing URI omits `methods` and `chains`, the wallet MUST
treat this as a broad scope request and MUST display a prominent
warning to the user that the dApp did not declare its intent. The
wallet MAY require explicit per-method user confirmation in this case.

#### DApp side

After receiving the wallet's granted `capabilities` in `join`:

1. The dApp MUST check whether the granted capabilities satisfy its
   requirements. If not, the dApp SHOULD `close` with
   `unsupported_capability`.
2. The dApp MUST adapt its behavior to the granted capabilities. For
   example, if the dApp requested `wallet_sendTransaction` but the
   wallet only granted `wallet_signTransaction`, the dApp SHOULD fall
   back to sign-then-broadcast mode (see §8.2) rather than rejecting
   the wallet.
3. The dApp MUST NOT call methods that are not in the granted
   `capabilities.methods` — the wallet will reject them with
   `unsupported_method`.

#### Scope enforcement

The wallet's granted `capabilities` define the session ceiling. The
wallet MUST enforce:

1. The wallet MUST reject any `req` whose `method` is not in
   `capabilities.methods` with error `unsupported_method`.
2. The wallet MUST reject any request targeting a chain not in
   `capabilities.chains` with error `unsupported_chain`.
3. The wallet MUST only expose accounts that were authorized for this
   session. Accounts authorized in one session MUST NOT leak into
   another.

Session scope changes (account additions/removals, chain changes) are
communicated via `accountsChanged` and `chainChanged` events. The wallet
MUST NOT expand the session's method scope after pairing without the
dApp initiating a new session.

### 8.2 Sign-Only Wallets (Cold Wallets)

A wallet that cannot broadcast transactions (e.g., hardware wallets,
air-gapped wallets, offline signers) grants `wallet_signTransaction`
but not `wallet_sendTransaction`. The dApp detects this from the
granted capabilities and adapts accordingly.

**Example negotiation:**

```text
dApp URI:    methods=wallet_sendTransaction   (dApp's minimum requirement)
Cold wallet: grants wallet_signTransaction     (what the wallet can actually do)

→ dApp receives capabilities, sees signTransaction but not sendTransaction
→ dApp adapts: sign-then-broadcast mode (dApp broadcasts via its own RPC)
```

**Sign-only flow:**

1. DApp sends `req` with `_method: "wallet_signTransaction"` and the
   unsigned transaction.
2. Wallet signs the transaction and returns the signed transaction bytes
   (or signature) in `_result`.
3. DApp broadcasts the signed transaction to the network via its own
   RPC provider.

**Capability declaration example** (sign-only wallet):

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "methods": [
      "wallet_signTransaction",
      "wallet_signMessage",
      "wallet_getAccounts"
    ],
    "events": ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"],
    "chains": ["eip155:1"]
  }
}
```

The dApp MUST check `capabilities.methods` to determine whether to use
`wallet_sendTransaction` (wallet signs and broadcasts) or fall back to
`wallet_signTransaction` (sign-only, dApp broadcasts). The dApp
MUST NOT send `wallet_sendTransaction` to a wallet that did not
grant it — the wallet will reject it with `unsupported_method`.

**Broadcast idempotency.** When the dApp broadcasts a signed transaction
received from a sign-only wallet, the dApp is responsible for its own
broadcast idempotency (e.g., deduplicating by tx hash). The wallet's
idempotency cache (§10 rule 6) ensures that retried `wallet_signTransaction`
requests with the same `req.id` return the same signature without
re-prompting the user.

## 9. Pairing Flow

### 9.1 Pairing URI

The dApp generates a pairing URI that encodes the channel ID, the dApp public
key, and the relay endpoint. The wallet obtains this URI through an
**out-of-band channel** that is not controlled by the relay or any network
intermediary.

**Mandatory out-of-band delivery.** The pairing URI contains the dApp's
public key, which is the trust anchor for the entire session. The URI
MUST be delivered through a channel where a network attacker or
malicious relay cannot substitute the content:

| Delivery method         | Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Status                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| QR code (optical scan)  | Camera captures dApp screen directly. Relay not in path.                                                                                                                                                                                        | **REQUIRED** support.                               |
| Deep link / URL scheme  | **INSECURE.** URI passes through OS URL handler, clipboard, browser extensions, or intent system. A malicious intermediary can replace the entire URI including the dApp public key, enabling a full MITM that no protocol-level defense can detect. | **MUST NOT** be used as the sole pairing mechanism. |
| Copy-paste              | URI may be intercepted by clipboard monitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **MUST NOT** be used as the sole pairing mechanism. |

Wallets MUST support QR code scanning as the primary pairing method.
Wallets MUST NOT offer deep link or copy-paste as the only pairing
option. If a wallet supports deep link pairing as a convenience
mechanism (e.g., same-device dApp-to-wallet), it MUST display a
prominent security warning: "This connection was not established via
secure out-of-band channel. A malicious app on this device could
intercept the connection. For high-value transactions, use QR code
pairing from a separate device."

DApps MUST display a QR code as the primary pairing interface. DApps
MUST display the session fingerprint (§7.3) alongside the QR code so the
wallet user can verify the connection. DApps MAY additionally offer deep
links but MUST label them as "Less secure — same device only."

Format:

```text

Parameters:

| Param            | Required                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ch`           | yes                     | Channel ID (hex, 64 chars).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `pubkey`       | yes                     | DApp X25519 public key (base64url, no padding).                                                                                                                                                 |
| `relay`        | yes for relay transport | WebSocket relay URL (percent-encoded).                                                                                                                                                          |
| `name`         | yes                     | DApp display name.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `url`          | yes                     | DApp website URL (percent-encoded).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `icon`         | yes                     | DApp icon URL (percent-encoded). MUST be `https:` scheme.                                                                                                                                       |
| `methods`      | optional                | Comma-separated list of methods the dApp requires. The wallet MUST display these to the user during pairing and MUST check that it can satisfy them (see §8.1). The wallet MAY grant additional methods beyond this list. |
| `chains`       | optional                | Comma-separated list of CAIP-2 chains the dApp requires. The wallet MUST display these to the user during pairing and MUST check that it can satisfy them (see §8.1). The wallet MAY grant additional chains beyond this list. |

When `methods` or `chains` are present, the wallet MUST show the user
what the dApp is requesting and what the wallet will grant before the
user confirms the connection. If `methods` or `chains` are absent, the
wallet MUST warn the user that the dApp did not declare its intent
(see §8.1).

For Bluetooth pairing, the URI may omit `relay` and instead be
transmitted through a local QR code displayed by the dApp.

Multiple relay endpoints can be specified by repeating the `relay` parameter:

```text
walletpair:?ch=...&pubkey=...&relay=wss%3A%2F%2Fr1.example.com%2Fv1&relay=wss%3A%2F%2Fr2.example.com%2Fv1
```

The dApp must create the channel on all listed relays. The wallet tries relays
in order and uses the first one that connects. Since the root and traffic keys
are derived from the peer keys and handshake transcript (not the relay),
switching relays does not affect encryption.

### 9.2 DApp Creates Channel

The dApp connects to the relay and sends:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "create",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "meta": {
      "name": "MyDApp",
      "description": "A decentralized exchange",
      "url": "https://mydapp.com",
      "icon": "https://mydapp.com/icon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

**DApp `meta` fields:**

| Field         | Required | Description                      |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | DApp display name.               |
| `description` | yes      | Short description of the dApp.   |
| `url`         | yes      | DApp website URL.                |
| `icon`        | yes      | DApp icon URL. MUST be `https:`. |

The `meta` in `create` is plaintext and visible to the relay.

The relay replies:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "waiting",
    "role": "dapp",
    "self": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "remote": null,
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

### 9.3 Wallet Joins

The wallet scans the pairing URI, generates its keypair, computes its local
root key and session fingerprint, displays the requested scope and
fingerprint, and asks the user to confirm the fingerprint matches the
dApp's display:

```text
Wallet: "Connect to MyDApp (https://mydapp.com)?
Requested: wallet_signTransaction on eip155:1.
Session: 4821. Verify this matches the dApp."
```

The dApp displays the same fingerprint alongside the QR code (e.g.,
"Session: 4821"). After the user confirms they match, the wallet connects
to the relay and sends `join` with
capabilities and metadata encrypted in `sealed_join` (Section 7.5):

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "join",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": "base64url-encrypted-capabilities-and-meta"
  }
}
```

The relay cannot read the wallet's capabilities, supported chains, or
identity from this message.

The relay does two things:

1. Forwards the `join` message to the dApp.
2. Sends `ready.waiting` back to the wallet:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "waiting",
    "role": "wallet",
    "self": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "remote": null,
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

At this point:

- The user has verified the session fingerprint and confirmed the connection.
- The dApp now has the wallet's public key and can compute the same root key,
  transcript hash, and traffic keys.
- The dApp can verify the wallet by decrypting `sealed_join` — successful
  decryption proves the wallet possesses the dApp's public key (obtained
  via the out-of-band QR code).

### 9.4 DApp Accepts Wallet

The dApp decrypts `sealed_join` and verifies the wallet's capabilities.
If decryption succeeds, the wallet is authenticated — it must have obtained
the dApp's public key from the QR code (out-of-band channel). The dApp
MAY auto-accept the wallet without additional user interaction.

The dApp MAY display the wallet's metadata (name, capabilities) to the
user before accepting. The dApp sends:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "accept",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "target": "base64url-wallet-pubkey"
  }
}
```

The relay sends `ready.connected` to both peers:

DApp receives:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "connected",
    "role": "dapp",
    "self": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "remote": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

Wallet receives:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "connected",
    "role": "wallet",
    "self": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "remote": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

From this point on, both sides must encrypt payloads using the appropriate
direction-specific traffic key.
Both peers initialize their send and receive sequence counters to 0.

## 10. Request and Response

The dApp calls a wallet method with `req`. After `ready.connected`, all
payloads are encrypted.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "req",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "req-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-params"
  }
}
```

The decrypted `sealed` contains `{ "_method": "wallet_signTransaction", ...params }`.

The wallet replies with exactly one `res`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "res",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "req-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-response"
  }
}
```

The decrypted `sealed` contains a `_ok` boolean that indicates success or
failure:

Successful response (decrypted):

```json
{
  "_ok": true,
  "_result": { "txHash": "0x..." }
}
```

Failed response (decrypted):

```json
{
  "_ok": false,
  "code": "user_rejected",
  "message": "User rejected the request"
}
```

Rules:

1. Only the dApp sends `req`.
2. Only the wallet sends `res`.
3. `res.id` must equal the matching `req.id`.
4. A request receives exactly one response.
5. The decrypted `req.sealed` is `{ "_method": "<name>", ...params }`.
   The decrypted `res.sealed` contains `_ok` (boolean) and either
   `_result` (on success) or `code`/`message` (on error). See §5.3.
6. **Request idempotency.** The wallet MUST cache every processed
   request ID, its params hash, and its decrypted response (result or
   error object). The cache MUST hold at least the most recent 1024
   processed requests, evicted in LRU order. Wallets MAY use a larger
   cache. If a retried request's ID has been evicted, the wallet
   processes it as a new request (which is safe for read-only methods;
   for `wallet_sendTransaction`, see the broadcast-idempotency rule
   below).
   If the wallet receives a `req` with an `id` it has already processed
   and the entry is still in the cache:

   - If the params hash matches, the wallet MUST return the cached
     response by re-encrypting the cached result/error with a fresh
     sequence number. The wallet MUST NOT replay the old `sealed`
     bytes (they would be rejected by the sequence number rule).
   - If the params hash differs, the wallet MUST reject with
     `invalid_params` ("Duplicate request ID with different params").
     The **canonical params hash** is `SHA-256(plaintext_json_utf8)` —
     the raw UTF-8 bytes of the decrypted params JSON, before any
     parsing. The dApp MUST cache and reuse the exact
     `plaintext_json_utf8` bytes when retrying a request. The dApp
     MUST NOT re-serialize params from parsed objects, as this may
     produce different key ordering or whitespace.
     For `wallet_sendTransaction` specifically (wallets that both sign
     and broadcast): if the wallet has already signed and broadcast a
     transaction for a given `req.id`, it MUST NOT sign or broadcast
     again — it MUST return the original `txHash`. To ensure this
     guarantee survives cache eviction, the wallet MUST persist
     broadcast tx hashes separately (keyed by `req.id`) with a
     maximum of **256 entries**, evicted in LRU order. If a broadcast
     tx hash entry has been evicted and the same `req.id` is retried,
     the wallet MUST re-process the request as new (the nonce will
     likely fail on-chain with `nonce_too_low`, which is safe). This
     cap bounds worst-case persistent storage to 256 × (request ID +
     32-byte tx hash) ≈ 20 KB. Sign-only wallets (§8.2) do not
     broadcast and are not subject to this rule — standard cache
     idempotency is sufficient.

   **Cache entry size limit.** Each cached entry MUST store at most the
   params hash (32 bytes), the response status (`_ok`), and the
   serialized response JSON. The wallet MUST cap individual cached
   response entries at 16 KB. If a response exceeds this limit, the
   wallet stores only the params hash and a flag indicating "response
   too large to cache"; on a cache hit with this flag, the wallet
   re-processes the request (safe for read-only methods). For
   `wallet_sendTransaction` (broadcast wallets only, see §8.2), the
   broadcast tx hash (32 bytes) is always stored regardless of this
   limit.

   **Worst-case memory.** With 1024 cache entries at 16 KB each, the
   maximum idempotency cache size is 16 MB. Combined with the 32
   concurrent pending requests limit (§16 rule 10), a malicious dApp
   can generate at most 32 new cache entries per round-trip cycle.
   Wallets on memory-constrained devices MAY use a smaller cache
   (minimum 128 entries) and MUST document the reduced cache size in
   their capability declaration.

   **Cache security.** The idempotency cache contains decrypted
   response data, which may include signed transactions, signatures,
   or account information. Wallet implementations MUST store the cache
   in memory that is not swappable to disk, or encrypt the cache at
   rest using a key derived from the session's traffic key. The cache
   MUST be securely erased (zeroed) when the channel is closed. On
   platforms that do not support memory locking (e.g., browser
   environments), implementations SHOULD minimize cache lifetime and
   clear entries as soon as the dApp acknowledges receipt.

## 11. Wallet Events

The wallet can push an event to the dApp with `evt`.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "evt",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "evt-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-data"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. Only the wallet sends `evt`.
2. Events do not require a response.
3. Event ordering is transport-order while the connection is alive.
4. WalletPair v1 does not guarantee event replay after reconnect.
5. If events are critical, the dApp should call a snapshot method after
   reconnect, such as `wallet_getAccounts`.

## 12. Heartbeat

Either peer may send `ping`.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ping",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {}
}
```

The receiver replies with `pong`.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "pong",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000100,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {}
}
```

Heartbeat messages are not encrypted (they carry no sensitive payload) and
do not consume sequence numbers.

Recommended timing:

```text
ping interval  : 30 seconds
timeout        : 60 seconds
```

If no `pong` is received within the timeout, the peer should treat the
connection as dead, close the transport, and begin reconnect (Section 14).

### 12.1 Heartbeat Security

Heartbeat messages are **not encrypted** and do not consume sequence
numbers. This is intentional — heartbeats carry no sensitive payload and
must function even when encryption state is being established.

However, implementations MUST be aware of the following implications:

1. **Relay-forged heartbeats.** A malicious relay can forge `ping` or
   `pong` messages (including the `from` field) since they are not
   authenticated. This cannot cause data compromise but may confuse
   liveness detection.
2. **Heartbeat suppression.** A malicious relay can drop `pong` responses
   to make peers believe the connection is dead, triggering reconnection.
   This is a denial-of-service vector equivalent to the relay dropping
   any other message type — see §20.5.
3. **Timing metadata.** The `ts` field and heartbeat frequency are
   visible to the relay and can be used for timing analysis (e.g.,
   determining if a peer is active).

These risks are within the accepted threat model: a relay can always deny
service by dropping messages (§20.5). Peers SHOULD use reconnect logic
(§14) and multiple relays (§18.5) to mitigate relay-initiated disruption.

## 13. Close, Reject, and Terminate

### 13.1 Close (peer-initiated)

`close` is sent by a peer to end the channel or reject an operation.

Reject a wallet join request:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "close",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "reason": "user_rejected"
  }
}
```

Normal close:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "close",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "reason": "normal"
  }
}
```

### 13.2 Terminate (adapter-initiated)

`terminate` is sent by the transport adapter to forcibly end a channel.
Only the adapter may send `terminate`. Peers MUST NOT send it.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "terminate",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "reason": "timeout"
  }
}
```

### 13.3 Reasons

The following reasons apply to both `close` and `terminate`. Some
reasons are only used by peers (P), some only by the adapter (A),
and some by both:

| Reason                     | Used by | Meaning                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `normal`                 | P       | Normal close.                                                   |
| `user_rejected`          | P       | User rejected the wallet or closed the channel.                 |
| `unsupported_capability` | P       | Wallet does not support a required chain or method.             |
| `unsupported_version`    | P       | Peer sent a `v` value the receiver does not support.          |
| `decryption_failed`      | P       | Receiver could not decrypt `sealed` (bad seq, tampered data). |
| `channel_not_found`      | A       | Wallet tried to join a missing channel.                         |
| `channel_exists`         | A       | Another dApp already owns the channel.                          |
| `already_connected`      | A       | Channel already has one dApp and one wallet.                    |
| `invalid_state`          | P, A    | Message is not allowed in current state.                        |
| `invalid_role`           | P, A    | Peer sent a message not allowed for its role.                   |
| `timeout`                | P, A    | Heartbeat, pairing confirmation, or session lifetime timed out. |
| `rate_limited`           | P, A    | Too many pending requests or messages.                          |
| `payload_too_large`      | P, A    | Message exceeds 64 KB.                                          |
| `protocol_error`         | P, A    | Malformed or unsupported message.                               |

## 14. Reconnect

Reconnect reuses the same `create`/`join`/`accept` flow as initial pairing,
but both peers already hold the traffic keys and sequence counters from the
original session. The relay does not need to remember anything — it treats
a reconnect exactly like a new channel.

### 14.1 How Reconnect Works

Both peers persist `{ ch, relay_url, peer_public_key, traffic_keys,
sequence_counters }` across transport disconnections.

**DApp reconnects** by sending `create` with the same `ch` and `from`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "create",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "meta": {
      "name": "MyDApp",
      "description": "A decentralized exchange",
      "url": "https://mydapp.com",
      "icon": "https://mydapp.com/icon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

The relay creates a channel (or matches an existing one by `ch`) and replies
with `ready.waiting`.

**Wallet reconnects** by sending `join` with `sealed_join` set to `null`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "join",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": null
  }
}
```

On reconnect, `sealed_join` is `null` because capabilities were already
negotiated during the initial pairing. The dApp already has the session
scope from the original handshake.

The relay forwards `join` to the dApp. The dApp sees `sealed_join: null`
and recognizes this as a reconnect from a known wallet (by matching `from`
against its persisted `peer_public_key`). The dApp auto-sends `accept`.

The relay sends `ready.connected` to both peers with `reconnect: true`.

### 14.2 Identity Verification

The relay does not verify peer identity — it is a stateless forwarder. Identity
is verified end-to-end:

1. **DApp verifies wallet:** On reconnect, the dApp checks that the wallet's
   `from` matches the persisted wallet public key. The wallet then proves
   possession of the corresponding private key by sending sealed messages
   that the dApp can decrypt with the existing traffic keys.
2. **Wallet verifies dApp:** The wallet checks that the dApp's `from` in
   `ready.connected` matches the persisted dApp public key. The dApp proves
   possession by sending sealed messages the wallet can decrypt.

An attacker who knows the public key and channel ID could attempt to reconnect
first ("channel squatting"). However, the attacker cannot decrypt or forge
sealed messages without the traffic keys derived from the X25519 shared
secret. The legitimate peer detects the impostor when AEAD decryption fails
and closes the channel.

### 14.3 Sequence Counter Persistence

If a peer loses its persisted sequence counter (e.g., due to app crash
or storage corruption), it MUST NOT attempt to reconnect. It MUST close
the channel and initiate a fresh pairing, because reusing sequence
numbers with the same traffic key would break AEAD security.

**Sequence counter persistence strategy.** Implementations MUST use
write-ahead persistence: increment and persist the counter value
**before** sending the message. This ensures that a crash between
persist and send results in a harmless gap (the remote peer accepts
gaps per §7.4), rather than a dangerous counter reuse. Recommended
storage backends by platform:

- **Browser:** IndexedDB (not localStorage, which may be cleared by
  user or browser). Implementations SHOULD use a dedicated object
  store with explicit `durableObjectStore` transactions where
  available.
- **Mobile (iOS/Android):** Platform keychain or encrypted file
  storage. The counter MUST survive app termination and OS-initiated
  process kills.
- **Desktop/Server:** File-backed storage with `fsync` after each
  write, or a lightweight embedded database (e.g., SQLite with WAL
  mode).

If the platform cannot guarantee durable persistence (e.g., ephemeral
browser contexts, incognito mode), the implementation MUST NOT support
reconnect and MUST treat every transport disconnection as a terminal
channel close requiring fresh pairing.

### 14.4 After Reconnect

The previously negotiated traffic keys remain valid. Peers continue
using their persisted send and receive sequence counters. **Sequence
counters must never be reset**, because doing so would cause nonce reuse
and break AEAD security.

After reconnect, there may be gaps in the sequence numbers (in-flight
messages lost when the transport dropped). The sequence validation rule
in Section 7.4 (must be strictly greater than last accepted) already
handles this correctly without special-case logic.

Recommended reconnect backoff:

```text
1s -> 2s -> 5s -> 10s -> 30s
```

After reconnect:

1. The dApp may retry pending requests with the same `req.id` (using new
   sequence numbers for encryption).
2. The wallet MUST deduplicate duplicate request IDs per Section 10 rule 6.
   The wallet's idempotency cache persists for the channel lifetime, so
   retried requests after reconnect are handled correctly.
3. The dApp should refresh state by calling a method like `wallet_getAccounts`
   if missed events matter.

## 15. State Machine

### DApp State

```text
idle
  -> send create ---------------------------------> waiting
waiting
  -> receive join -------------------------------> pending_accept
  -> receive close or terminate -----------------> closed
  -> timeout ------------------------------------> closed
pending_accept
  -> sealed_join verified -> send accept ---------> connected
  -> user rejects -> send close -----------------> closed
  -> receive terminate --------------------------> closed
  -> timeout ------------------------------------> closed
  (A second `join` in this state MUST be rejected by the adapter
   with `already_connected` per §16 rule 4.)
connected
  -> send req
  -> receive res
  -> receive evt
  -> send/receive ping/pong
  -> send close ---------------------------------> closed
  -> receive close or terminate -----------------> closed
  -> transport disconnected ---------------------> disconnected
  -> session lifetime expired (§16 rule 16) -----> closed
disconnected
  -> send create (same ch, from) ----------------> waiting
     (relay treats as new channel creation;
      wallet rejoins with sealed_join=null)
  -> session lifetime expired (§16 rule 16) -----> closed
  -> give up ------------------------------------> closed
closed
  (terminal state)
```

### Wallet State

```text

  -> give up ------------------------------------> closed
closed
  (terminal state)
```

## 16. Protocol Rules

1. A channel is created by the dApp.
2. A channel is joined by the wallet.
3. The dApp must accept the wallet before the channel is connected.
4. A channel can have at most one dApp and one wallet.
5. Only the dApp sends `req`.
6. Only the wallet sends `res` and `evt`.
7. `req`, `res`, and `evt` are valid only after `ready.connected`.
8. After `ready.connected`, payload content must be encrypted in the `sealed`
   field using the direction-specific traffic key.
9. A closed channel cannot carry more requests, responses, or events.
10. A single message must not exceed 64 KB on the wire.
11. A peer MUST NOT have more than 32 pending (unanswered) requests per
    channel. If a dApp sends a `req` that would exceed this limit, the
    wallet MUST reject it with error code `rate_limited` and message
    "Too many pending requests". The dApp MUST wait for at least one
    pending response before sending another request.
12. If a peer receives a message with an unsupported `v` value, it MUST reply
    with `close` reason `unsupported_version`. If the adapter detects an
    unsupported version, it sends `terminate` with the same reason.
13. Encryption sequence counters must never be reset. They persist across
    reconnects for the lifetime of the channel.
14. Each peer MUST locally verify that encrypted messages come from the expected
    remote peer public key. Relay role enforcement is an availability aid, not
    a cryptographic trust boundary.
15. A peer MUST reject `ready.connected` if `remote` does not match the peer
    public key used to derive the handshake transcript.
16. **Session expiry.** A channel MUST have a maximum session lifetime.
    The recommended default is 24 hours from `ready.connected`. Both
    peers MUST track the session start time and close the channel with
    reason `timeout` when the lifetime expires. After expiry, the peers
    MUST initiate a fresh pairing to re-establish a channel (reconnect
    MUST NOT be used after session expiry). The wallet SHOULD display
    the remaining session lifetime to the user and warn before expiry.
    If a peer receives a message on an expired session, it MUST respond
    with `close` reason `timeout`. The relay SHOULD also enforce session
    expiry independently and terminate channels that exceed the
    configured TTL (using `terminate` with reason `timeout`).
    Implementations MAY allow users to configure a shorter session
    lifetime but MUST NOT allow unlimited sessions.

## 17. Transport Requirements

A transport adapter must provide:

1. Bidirectional delivery.
2. Ordered delivery while connected.
3. Channel creation by the dApp.
4. Wallet join delivery to the dApp.
5. Generation of `ready` messages to both peers (including `ready.waiting` to
   the wallet after a valid `join`).
6. State enforcement per Section 15.
7. Role enforcement per Section 3.
8. Heartbeat timeout handling.

The adapter may be centralized or peer-to-peer.

## 18. WebSocket Relay Binding

### 18.1 Relay Philosophy

A WalletPair relay is a dumb pipe. It routes messages by channel ID and
enforces basic protocol state. It does not:

- require registration, API keys, or project IDs
- inspect or decrypt payload content
- store long-term user data
- need any configuration beyond a listen address

A minimal relay can be a single binary under 1000 lines of code.

### 18.2 Connection

Example endpoint:

```text
wss://relay.example.com/v1
```

WebSocket subprotocol:

```text
walletpair.v1
```

### 18.3 Relay Behavior

The relay must:

1. Accept WalletPair JSON messages over WebSocket text frames.
2. Track channel state in memory (no persistent storage required).
3. Create a channel when it receives `create` from a dApp. Reply with
   `ready.waiting` to the dApp.
4. When it receives `join` from a wallet: forward the `join` to the dApp and
   reply with `ready.waiting` to the wallet.
5. Upon receiving `accept` from the dApp, send `ready.connected` to both peers.
6. Forward `req` to the wallet only after `ready.connected`.
7. Forward `res` and `evt` to the dApp only after `ready.connected`.
8. Reject invalid role or state transitions with `terminate`.
9. Expire channels after a configurable TTL (recommended: 5 minutes for
   unpaired channels, 24 hours for connected channels).

The relay MUST implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- Per-IP channel creation rate limit (recommended: 10 channels per
  minute per IP).
- Per-IP connection limit (recommended: 50 concurrent connections
  per IP).
- Message rate limit per channel (recommended: 60 messages per
  minute per peer).

These limits preserve the "zero registration" principle while preventing
resource exhaustion attacks. The specific numeric thresholds above are
recommendations; relay operators MAY adjust them based on their
deployment context, but MUST enforce non-zero limits in all three
categories. A relay that does not rate-limit channel creation is
trivially vulnerable to resource exhaustion by a single attacker
rotating IP addresses.

The relay MUST also enforce global resource limits:

- Maximum concurrent channels (recommended: 10,000). When exceeded,
  new `create` messages receive `terminate` with `rate_limited`.
- Maximum total bandwidth (recommended: 100 MB/min aggregate). When
  exceeded, the relay SHOULD throttle new messages with backpressure
  rather than dropping existing channels.
- Maximum message size is 64 KB per the protocol limit (§16 rule 10).

To mitigate Sybil attacks from botnets or IPv6 rotation, relay
operators SHOULD consider additional anti-abuse mechanisms:

- Proof-of-work / hashcash challenge on `create` (the relay MAY
  respond with a challenge before accepting channel creation).
- Connection-level TLS fingerprinting to detect automated clients.
- Anomaly detection on channel creation patterns (e.g., many channels
  created but never paired).

These mechanisms are relay-implementation details and are not part of
the protocol wire format. They do not affect protocol interoperability.

The relay must not:

1. Require any form of authentication, registration, or API key.
2. Inspect, log, or store `sealed` content beyond immediate delivery.

### 18.4 Self-Hosting

A relay should be deployable with a single command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 walletpair/relay
```

No environment variables, API keys, or external dependencies are required for
basic operation. Operators may optionally configure:

- Listen address and port
- TLS certificate (or use a reverse proxy)
- Channel TTL values
- Maximum concurrent channels

### 18.5 Relay Restart Recovery

Because the relay is stateless (in-memory only), a relay restart clears
all channel state. Both peers detect the WebSocket disconnection and
automatically recover using the reconnect flow (§14):

1. Both peers detect WebSocket close.
2. Both peers reconnect to the same relay URL (from the pairing URI)
   with backoff.
3. DApp sends `create` with the original `ch` and `from`.
4. Wallet sends `join` with the original `ch` and `from`,
   `sealed_join: null`.
5. DApp matches `from` against its persisted wallet public key and
   sends `accept`.
6. Relay sends `ready.connected` to both. Communication resumes with
   the persisted traffic keys and sequence counters.

From the relay's perspective, this is indistinguishable from a fresh
channel — no prior state is needed. From the peers' perspective, the
session continues seamlessly without re-pairing or re-scanning a QR code.

## 19. Bluetooth Binding

### 19.1 Overview

In Bluetooth mode, the dApp still owns the WalletPair channel, regardless of
Bluetooth central/peripheral roles.

Bluetooth is ideal for local pairing when no internet is available. The
protocol messages are identical; only the transport layer changes.

In Bluetooth mode, there is no relay. The BLE stack itself acts as the
transport adapter and must enforce state transitions and generate `ready`
messages locally.

### 19.2 Discovery

The dApp creates a channel and exposes the pairing URI via QR code.
The wallet scans the QR code to obtain the pairing URI.

The QR code contains the pairing URI (Section 9.1) without the `relay`
parameter.

### 19.3 BLE Service

WalletPair BLE GATT service definition:

```text
Service UUID: 0000FE70-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Characteristic: Channel (read)     - returns pairing URI
    UUID: 0000FE71-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Characteristic: Message (write)    - wallet writes messages to dApp
    UUID: 0000FE72-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Characteristic: Message (notify)   - dApp sends messages to wallet
    UUID: 0000FE73-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
```

Note: The UUIDs above use the Bluetooth SIG 16-bit UUID base
(`0000xxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`) with values in the `FE70-FE73`
range reserved for experimental/member use. Production deployments SHOULD
register a 16-bit UUID with the Bluetooth SIG or use a fully random
128-bit UUID to avoid collisions with other services.

### 19.4 Flow

1. DApp creates `ch`. BLE adapter returns `ready.waiting` to the dApp.
2. DApp exposes pairing URI via QR code.
3. Wallet discovers the pairing URI and obtains the dApp's public key.
4. Wallet computes its local root key and session fingerprint. User
   verifies the fingerprint matches the dApp's display and confirms.
5. Wallet sends `join` with public key and capabilities.
6. BLE adapter forwards `join` to dApp and sends `ready.waiting` to wallet.
7. DApp computes the root key, transcript hash, and traffic keys.
8. DApp verifies `sealed_join` and sends `accept`.
9. BLE adapter generates `ready.connected` for both sides.
10. DApp sends `req`. Wallet sends `res` and optional `evt`.
11. All payloads are encrypted with direction-specific traffic keys.

### 19.5 Message Framing

Bluetooth MTU is typically small (23-517 bytes). Messages larger than MTU
must be fragmented. Recommended framing for each BLE write/notification:

```text
[1 byte flags] [2 bytes total length, big-endian unsigned] [payload fragment]

flags:
  bit 0: 1 = first fragment
  bit 1: 1 = last fragment
  bits 2-7: reserved
```

The `total length` field is only meaningful in the first fragment and
indicates the total payload size (max 65535 bytes, within the 64 KB protocol
limit). Subsequent fragments set total length to 0.

The receiver assembles fragments until the last-fragment flag is set, then
parses the complete JSON message.

**Fragmentation security limits.** The receiver MUST enforce the following
to prevent resource exhaustion from malicious or malfunctioning peers:

- **Fragment timeout:** If the last-fragment flag is not received within
  **5 seconds** of the first fragment, the receiver MUST discard all
  buffered fragments for that message and MAY close the BLE connection.
- **Maximum fragment count:** The receiver MUST accept at most **256
  fragments** per message. If a 257th fragment arrives before the
  last-fragment flag, the receiver MUST discard all buffered fragments.
- **Total size validation:** On receiving the first fragment, the receiver
  MUST verify that `total length` does not exceed 65535 bytes (the 64 KB
  protocol limit). If it does, the receiver MUST discard the fragment
  immediately.
- **MTU negotiation:** Implementations SHOULD request ATT MTU exchange
  after BLE connection establishment. The fragment payload size MUST NOT
  exceed `(negotiated_MTU - 3)` bytes (3 bytes for the fragment header).
  If MTU negotiation is not available, implementations MUST use a
  conservative default payload size of 20 bytes (minimum ATT MTU of
  23 minus 3 bytes header).
- **Out-of-order delivery:** BLE GATT indications provide ordered
  delivery. Implementations MUST use indications (not notifications) for
  message fragments, or implement a sequence counter at the fragment
  level if notifications are used. If a fragment arrives out of order,
  the receiver MUST discard all buffered fragments for that message.

### 19.6 Bluetooth Security Considerations

1. **Proximity assumption.** Unlike relay-based pairing, Bluetooth
   pairing implicitly assumes physical proximity. However, BLE range
   can extend beyond visual range (especially with directional
   antennas). Implementations MUST NOT rely on Bluetooth proximity as
   a security property — the QR code is the trust anchor for public
   key delivery, not physical distance. The wallet SHOULD display the
   dApp name prominently and require explicit user confirmation.
2. **BLE connection hijacking.** A nearby attacker could attempt to
   connect to the dApp's BLE service before the legitimate wallet.
   The dApp MUST enforce the one-wallet-per-channel rule (§16 rule 4).
   If a second device attempts to `join`, the BLE adapter MUST reject
   it with `already_connected`. If an attacker connects first, the
   legitimate wallet's `join` will be rejected, resulting in a
   denial-of-service — but not a security compromise (the attacker
   cannot sign transactions without the user's blockchain private keys).
3. **Denial of service.** A nearby attacker can jam BLE frequencies or
   flood the GATT service with connections. This is inherent to any
   wireless protocol.

## 20. Security

### 20.1 Threat Model

WalletPair assumes the transport (relay or Bluetooth) may be compromised.
The relay operator, network attacker, or eavesdropper should not be able to:

- read request parameters, response results, or event data
- impersonate a peer
- replay messages to cause duplicate signing

### 20.2 Protections

| Threat             | Protection                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Eavesdropping      | E2E encryption with X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305.                    |
| Man-in-the-middle  | Out-of-band public key delivery (QR); session fingerprint (§7.3) for user verification; `sealed_join` cryptographically binds wallet to QR-scanned dApp key. |
| Peer impersonation | Peer ID is the X25519 public key; end-to-end AEAD verification on reconnect (§14.2). |
| Replay             | Sequence-number-based nonce; receiver rejects out-of-order seq.    |
| Channel hijack     | Channel ID is 32 random bytes (256-bit entropy).                   |
| Relay compromise   | Relay only sees encrypted `sealed` blobs and routing metadata. Response success/failure (`_ok`) is encrypted. |

### 20.2.1 MITM Security Analysis

The primary MITM defense is **out-of-band public key delivery**, which is
mandatory (Section 9.1).

**Out-of-band public key delivery.** The dApp's public key is embedded in
the pairing URI. The wallet MUST obtain this URI through an out-of-band
channel where the relay and network attackers cannot substitute content
(see §9.1 for mandatory delivery methods). QR code optical scanning is the
required primary method: the wallet reads the dApp's screen directly, and
the relay is not in this path.

**`sealed_join` as cryptographic proof.** When the dApp receives a `join`
message and successfully decrypts `sealed_join`, this proves the wallet
possesses the dApp's public key — which could only have been obtained
through the out-of-band channel (QR code). A relay-positioned attacker
cannot forge a valid `sealed_join` because it does not have the dApp's
private key and therefore cannot compute the shared secret.

A relay-positioned attacker can only attempt a **half-MITM**: substituting
the wallet's public key in the forwarded `join` message. However, this
causes `sealed_join` decryption to fail on the dApp side:

```text
dApp side:   shared_secret = X25519(dapp_priv, attacker_pub)
Wallet side: shared_secret = X25519(wallet_priv, dapp_pub)  ← real, from QR

→ Different shared_secret → different join_encryption_key
→ sealed_join decryption fails → dApp rejects the join
```

The attacker cannot complete a full MITM because it cannot substitute the
dApp's public key (delivered via QR).

**Why impersonating a wallet is not a security threat.** A malicious relay
could generate its own key pair and send a valid `join` to the dApp
(since the relay knows `dapp_pub` from the `create` message). However,
this only achieves denial-of-service — the fake wallet cannot sign
blockchain transactions (it lacks the user's private keys) and cannot
cause financial loss. The user simply retries or switches relays.

**Deep link and non-OOB delivery threat.** When the pairing URI is delivered
through a software-controlled channel (deep link, clipboard, URL scheme
handler, browser extension), a malicious intermediary can replace the entire
URI — including the dApp public key and channel ID. The **session
fingerprint** (§7.3) defends against this: the legitimate dApp in the
user's browser displays a fingerprint derived from the real dApp public key,
while the wallet displays a fingerprint derived from the attacker's public
key. The user sees a mismatch and rejects the connection. This defense
requires that the user's browser is displaying the legitimate dApp — it
does not protect against phishing (fake dApp website).

This is why §9.1 mandates out-of-band delivery and prohibits deep link as
the sole pairing mechanism. Wallets that offer deep link convenience pairing
MUST display a security downgrade warning and SHOULD restrict deep-link
sessions to read-only methods (e.g., `wallet_getAccounts`) by default.

### 20.3 Rules

1. `ch` must be cryptographically random (256 bits).
2. `from` must match the sender's X25519 public key.
3. Ephemeral key pairs must be generated per channel.
4. Implementations must reject messages with sequence numbers that are not
   strictly greater than the last accepted value.
5. The relay must not log or store `sealed` content beyond delivery.
6. Sequence counters must never be reset for a given traffic key.

### 20.4 Privacy Considerations

The following fields are visible to the relay in plaintext:

- `ch` (channel ID)
- `from` (public key / peer ID)
- `t` (message type)
- `ts` (timestamp)

The following are always encrypted and invisible to the relay:

- **Capabilities and metadata:** Always encrypted in `sealed_join`
  (Section 7.5). The relay cannot read the wallet's supported chains,
  methods, wallet brand, or identity.
- **Method and event names:** Never present on the wire. Real names
  are carried only inside the encrypted `sealed` payload (Section 5.3).
  The relay cannot determine what operations are being performed.

A malicious relay can still observe traffic patterns (message frequency,
timing, message sizes) and the `from` field (public key). However, the
relay cannot determine: what chains the user uses, what methods the
wallet supports, the wallet brand, what operations are being performed,
or whether requests succeed or fail (the `_ok` status is inside the
encrypted `sealed` payload, not visible on the wire).

Relay operators MUST NOT log, index, or retain `join` message content
beyond the immediate delivery.

### 20.5 Terminate Message Trust

A `terminate` message is sent by the transport adapter (relay) with
`from` = `"_adapter"`. This means a malicious relay can terminate any
session at will. This is an inherent trust assumption of using a relay —
the relay can always sever the connection (e.g., by dropping WebSocket
frames).

The relay cannot forge encrypted messages or impersonate a peer (it does
not have the traffic keys), so the worst a malicious relay can do is deny
service. Peers SHOULD implement reconnect logic (Section 14) to recover
from relay-initiated disconnections. For critical operations, peers
SHOULD use multiple relays for redundancy.

### 20.6 Icon and Image URL Safety

URLs in `meta.icon` fields may be used for tracking (loading a remote
icon reveals the peer's IP address to the URL host). Implementations
SHOULD either:

- Not load remote URLs automatically, or
- Load them through a privacy proxy, or
- Only load URLs with `https:` scheme and warn on other schemes.

### 20.7 Key Material Lifecycle and Secure Erasure

Implementations MUST manage the lifecycle of all cryptographic key
material and MUST securely erase (zero) sensitive values as soon as they
are no longer needed. The following rules apply:

1. **`shared_secret`** (X25519 output): MUST be securely erased
   immediately after `root_key` is derived. It is never needed again.
2. **X25519 private key**: MUST be securely erased after
   `join_encryption_key` and traffic keys (`dapp_to_wallet_key`,
   `wallet_to_dapp_key`) are derived. Reconnect (Section 14) does not
   require the private key — it uses persisted traffic keys.
3. **`root_key`**: MUST be securely erased after `join_encryption_key`
   and traffic keys are derived. It is never needed again.
4. **`join_encryption_key`**: MUST be securely erased after `sealed_join`
   is encrypted (wallet) or decrypted (dApp). It is a one-shot key.
5. **`dapp_to_wallet_key` and `wallet_to_dapp_key`** (traffic keys):
   MUST be persisted for the channel lifetime (including across
   reconnects). MUST be securely erased when the channel is closed or
   the session expires (§16 rule 16).
6. **`transcript_hash`**: MUST be securely erased after traffic keys
   are derived. It is never needed again.
7. **Sequence counters**: MUST be persisted for the channel lifetime.
   MUST be securely erased when the channel is closed.
8. **Idempotency cache**: MUST be securely erased (zeroed) when the
   channel is closed. See §10 rule 6 for cache-specific security rules.

**Secure erasure** means overwriting the memory with zeroes (or random
bytes) before deallocation. On platforms that support it, implementations
SHOULD use memory-locking APIs (e.g., `mlock`, `VirtualLock`,
`sodium_mlock`) to prevent key material from being swapped to disk.

On platforms where memory locking is not available (e.g., browser
JavaScript environments), implementations MUST minimize the lifetime of
key material by erasing intermediate values (steps 1–4, 6) as soon as
derivation is complete, and SHOULD use `crypto.subtle` or WebAssembly
for key operations to reduce exposure in the JavaScript heap.

If a peer detects that persisted key material (traffic keys or sequence
counters) has been corrupted or lost (e.g., after an app crash),
it MUST NOT attempt to reconnect. It MUST close the channel and
initiate a fresh pairing, because reusing sequence numbers or operating
with incorrect keys would break AEAD security (see §14.1).

### 20.8 Idempotency Cache Side Channel

The idempotency cache (§10 rule 6) introduces a minor information
leakage vector: a malicious dApp can probe whether the wallet has
previously processed a specific request ID by observing the error
response type.

- If a `req.id` has been processed and the params hash differs, the
  wallet responds with `invalid_params` ("Duplicate request ID with
  different params").
- If the `req.id` is unknown, the wallet processes the request normally.

This allows a malicious dApp to enumerate which request IDs have been
cached. In practice, request IDs are dApp-generated and the dApp already
knows which requests it has sent, so this leakage is minimal.
Implementations SHOULD NOT add timing-based mitigations (e.g., constant-
time responses) as the complexity is not justified by the risk.

However, implementations MUST ensure that the cache lookup itself is not
vulnerable to timing attacks that reveal the cached response content
(e.g., through variable-time comparison of params hashes). The params
hash comparison MUST use constant-time comparison.

### Pairing URI (shown as QR code)

```text
walletpair:?ch=aabb01...eeff&pubkey=dGhpcyBpcyBh...&relay=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.example.com%2Fv1&name=MyDApp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmydapp.com&icon=https%3A%2F%2Fmydapp.com%2Ficon.png&methods=wallet_signTransaction,wallet_signMessage&chains=eip155:1,eip155:137
```

### DApp creates channel

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "create",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,

      "url": "https://mydapp.com",
      "icon": "https://mydapp.com/icon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

### Relay confirms channel created

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "waiting",
    "role": "dapp",
    "self": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "remote": null,
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

### Wallet joins with encrypted capabilities

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "join",

  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": "base64url-encrypted-capabilities-and-meta"
  }
}
```

The dApp decrypts `sealed_join` to recover the capabilities and metadata
(see Section 7.5). The decrypted content is:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "methods": ["wallet_signTransaction", "wallet_signMessage"],
    "events": ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"],
    "chains": ["eip155:1", "eip155:137"]
  },
  "meta": {
    "name": "MyWallet",
    "description": "A multi-chain wallet",
    "url": "https://mywallet.app",
    "icon": "https://mywallet.app/icon.png"
  }
}
```

### Relay confirms wallet joined

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "waiting",
    "role": "wallet",
    "self": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "remote": null,
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

### DApp verifies sealed_join and accepts

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "accept",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "target": "base64url-wallet-pubkey"
  }
}
```

### Relay sends ready.connected to both peers

DApp receives:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "connected",
    "role": "dapp",
    "self": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "remote": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

Wallet receives:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "ready",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "_adapter",
  "body": {
    "state": "connected",
    "role": "wallet",
    "self": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
    "remote": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
    "reconnect": false
  }
}
```

### DApp sends encrypted request (seq=0)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "req",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-dapp-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "req-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-params"
  }
}
```

The decrypted `sealed` contains `{ "_method": "wallet_signTransaction", ...params }`.

### Wallet sends encrypted response (seq=0)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "res",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "req-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-response"
  }
}
```

The decrypted `sealed` contains `{ "_ok": true, "_result": { "signature": "0x..." } }`.

### Wallet pushes encrypted event (seq=1)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "evt",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "base64url-wallet-pubkey",
  "body": {
    "id": "evt-001",
    "sealed": "base64url-encrypted-data"
  }
}
```

The decrypted `sealed` contains `{ "_event": "accountsChanged", ...data }`.

Note: The `join_encryption_key` is used to encrypt `sealed_join` before
the `join` message is sent. It is derived from `root_key` and
`channel_id_bytes` only — it does not depend on the transcript hash
(which is computed after `join` is received). Implementations MUST
securely erase this key after `sealed_join` is encrypted (wallet) or
decrypted (dApp).

Message: `wallet_getAccounts` request.

```text
traffic_key     = dapp_to_wallet_key
                = 782ccebad576c74dede0ba376a324d06b6aa7008b90116bc57c693171c41c074

seq             = 0
seq_bytes       = 00000000

nonce           = HMAC-SHA256(traffic_key, seq_bytes)[0:12]

AAD construction (`req` type):

```text
from   = "HJ_Yj0VgbZMqgMcYJK4VHRXXPnfeOOjgAIUuYU-ucBk"
id     = "req-001"

aad_header = 01                                     (type byte: req)
           || 002b 484a5f596a3056...7563426b         (lp(from), 43 bytes)
           || 0007 7265712d303031                     (lp("req-001"), 7 bytes)

aad_header hex = 01002b484a5f596a305667625a4d71674d63594a4b345648525858506e66654f4f6a674149557559552d7563426b00077265712d303031

aad = channel_id_bytes || aad_header
```

Plaintext (`_method` inside sealed):

```text
{"_method":"wallet_getAccounts","chain":"eip155:1"}

Implementations MUST verify that decrypting the above `sealed` value with
the computed `dapp_to_wallet_key`, `nonce`, and `aad` produces the expected
plaintext. Any deviation indicates an error in key derivation, canonical
JSON, transcript hashing, or AEAD implementation.
