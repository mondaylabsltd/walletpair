# WalletPair Protocol v1

Status: Release Candidate

WalletPair is a minimal, permissionless two-party channel protocol for
connecting dApps and wallets. All payloads are end-to-end encrypted. The
relay is a stateless message router that cannot read, forge, or replay
application data.

The protocol is transport-independent. The same messages run over
WebSocket relay, Bluetooth, or any ordered bidirectional transport.

See `walletpair-protocol-v1-rationale.md` for design decisions and
security analysis. See `walletpair-protocol-v1-guide.md` for
implementation guidance, platform advice, and complete examples.

## 1. Scope

WalletPair defines:

- channel creation and pairing URI
- key exchange and end-to-end encryption
- capability negotiation
- session fingerprint and user confirmation
- request, response, and event messages
- heartbeat, close, and reconnect

WalletPair does not define:

- wallet or signing logic
- business payload schemas (defined by sub-protocols)
- relay cluster architecture or storage backend

## 2. Roles

Each channel has exactly two peer roles and one adapter.

### DApp

Creates the channel, accepts the wallet, sends requests. May send:

```text
create, accept, req, ping, pong, close
```

To reject a wallet, the dApp sends `close` with an appropriate reason
(e.g., `user_rejected` or `unsupported_capability`). There is no
separate reject message.

### Wallet

Joins an existing channel, handles requests, pushes events. May send:

```text
join, res, evt, ping, pong, close
```

### Transport Adapter

The adapter (relay, BLE stack, etc.) manages channel state. It is not a
peer. It may send:

```text
ready, terminate
```

Adapter messages use `from` = `"_adapter"` (reserved identifier, not a
key). Peers MUST reject any peer-sent message where `from` equals
`"_adapter"`.

The wallet does not create channels. The dApp does not send events.

## 3. Identifiers

### Channel ID (`ch`)

The channel ID identifies one pending or connected channel. It must be a
random 32-byte value encoded as hex (64 characters).

### Sender Identity (`from`)

Present in every message:

- **Peer messages:** sender's X25519 public key, base64url no padding.
- **Adapter messages:** the string `"_adapter"`.

### Request ID (`id`)

Unique per `req`. The wallet copies the same `id` into the matching
`res`. SHOULD be UUID v4 or equivalent entropy.

## 4. Message Format

### 4.1 Envelope

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "t": "<message_type>",
  "ch": "<channel-id>",
  "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<base64url-pubkey-or-_adapter>",
  "body": { }
}
```

| Field  | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `v`    | yes | Protocol version. MUST be `1`. |
| `t`    | yes | Message type. |
| `ch`   | yes | Channel ID (hex, 64 chars). |
| `ts`   | yes | Sender timestamp (ms, Unix epoch). Informational only. |
| `from` | yes | Sender identity. |
| `body` | yes | Type-specific payload. |

`ts` is not a security input. Receivers MUST NOT reject messages solely
based on `ts`. Replay detection uses sequence counters (Section 6.4).
The relay MAY reject `ts` deviating more than 5 minutes from server time
as an availability heuristic.

### 4.2 Body Schemas

All listed fields are required. Use `null` when not applicable.

| `t` | `body` fields |
|-----|---------------|
| `create` | `meta` |
| `join` | `sealed_join` |
| `accept` | `target` |
| `ready` | `state`, `role`, `self`, `remote`, `reconnect` |
| `req` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `res` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `evt` | `id`, `sealed` |
| `ping` | (empty object) |
| `pong` | (empty object) |
| `close` | `reason` |
| `terminate` | `reason` |

| Field | In `body` of | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `meta` | `create` | Display metadata: `name`, `description`, `url`, `icon`. All required. |
| `sealed_join` | `join` | Encrypted capabilities and metadata (base64url). See Section 6.5. `null` on reconnect. |
| `target` | `accept` | Wallet public key (base64url). |
| `state` | `ready` | `"waiting"` or `"connected"`. |
| `role` | `ready` | `"dapp"` or `"wallet"`. |
| `self` | `ready` | Local peer public key (base64url). |
| `remote` | `ready` | Remote peer public key (base64url). `null` when `state` is `"waiting"`. |
| `reconnect` | `ready` | Boolean. `true` on reconnect, `false` on initial pairing. |
| `id` | `req`, `res`, `evt` | Request or event ID. |
| `sealed` | `req`, `res`, `evt` | Encrypted payload (base64url). See Section 6.4. |
| `reason` | `close`, `terminate` | Close or termination reason (Section 12). |

### 4.3 Sealed Payload Content

The `sealed` field contains encrypted JSON. Method and event names are
inside the encrypted payload, never in plaintext on the wire.

| Message type | Decrypted content |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `req` | `{ "_method": "<name>", ...params }` |
| `res` (success) | `{ "_ok": true, "_result": <value> }` |
| `res` (error) | `{ "_ok": false, "code": "<code>", "message": "<text>" }` |
| `evt` | `{ "_event": "<name>", ...data }` |

- `_method` is required in `req`. `_event` is required in `evt`. If
  missing, reject with `invalid_params`.
- `_ok` is required in all `res`. If missing, reject with
  `protocol_error`.
- `_result` may be any JSON value including `null`.
- Every `req`, `res`, and `evt` MUST carry `sealed` after
  `ready.connected`. A message without `sealed` MUST be rejected.

## 5. Message Types

Peer-sent:

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `create` | dApp -> adapter | Create channel |
| `join` | wallet -> dApp | Join channel |
| `accept` | dApp -> wallet | Accept wallet |
| `req` | dApp -> wallet | Encrypted request |
| `res` | wallet -> dApp | Encrypted response |
| `evt` | wallet -> dApp | Encrypted event |
| `ping` | either -> peer | Heartbeat |
| `pong` | either -> peer | Heartbeat reply |
| `close` | either -> peer | Close or reject |

Adapter-sent:

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `ready` | adapter -> peer | Channel state notification |
| `terminate` | adapter -> peer | Forced termination |

There is no separate `error` message. Request errors use `_ok = false`
inside encrypted `res`. Channel errors use `close`. Adapter shutdown
uses `terminate`.

## 6. Key Exchange and Encryption

### 6.1 Key Exchange

Both peers generate an ephemeral X25519 key pair per channel.

1. DApp generates key pair, embeds public key in pairing URI.
2. Wallet obtains dApp public key from pairing URI.
3. Wallet sends `join` with its public key in `from`.
4. DApp receives `join`, obtains wallet public key from `from`.
5. Both sides independently derive all keys.

### 6.2 Key Derivation

```text
shared_secret = X25519(local_private_key, remote_public_key)

root_key = HKDF-SHA256(
  ikm  = shared_secret,
  salt = channel_id_bytes,         // 32 bytes from hex
  info = "walletpair-v1 root"
)[0:32]
```

**Input validation (MUST):**

- The remote public key MUST be exactly 32 bytes. Reject otherwise.
- After computing the X25519 shared secret, implementations MUST
  perform a constant-time check that the result is not all-zero.
  An all-zero shared secret indicates that the remote public key is a
  low-order point (see RFC 7748 §6). If the check fails, abort the
  handshake immediately and close the channel.
- Implementations MUST NOT continue key derivation with a shared
  secret that is all-zero bytes.

Transcript hash (computed after `join` is received by dApp / sent by
wallet):

```text
lp(s) = uint16_be(byte_length(utf8(s))) || utf8(s)

transcript_hash = SHA256(
  "walletpair-v1-transcript" ||
  channel_id_bytes ||
  lp(dapp_pubkey_base64url) ||
  lp(wallet_pubkey_base64url) ||
  lp(canonical_json(capabilities or null)) ||
  lp(canonical_json(meta or null)) ||
  lp(dapp_name_from_pairing_uri or "")
)
```

Where `capabilities` and `meta` are from the decrypted `sealed_join`.

Direction-specific traffic keys:

```text
dapp_to_wallet_key = HKDF-SHA256(
  ikm  = root_key,
  salt = transcript_hash,
  info = "walletpair-v1 dapp-to-wallet"
)[0:32]

wallet_to_dapp_key = HKDF-SHA256(
  ikm  = root_key,
  salt = transcript_hash,
  info = "walletpair-v1 wallet-to-dapp"
)[0:32]
```

`req` uses `dapp_to_wallet_key`. `res` and `evt` use
`wallet_to_dapp_key`. The same key MUST NOT be used in both directions.

Join encryption key (for `sealed_join`, available before `join`):

```text
join_encryption_key = HKDF-SHA256(
  ikm  = root_key,
  salt = channel_id_bytes,
  info = "walletpair-v1 join-encryption"
)[0:32]
```

#### Canonical JSON

Deterministic JSON serialization, compatible with RFC 8785 (JCS) and
conforming to I-JSON (RFC 7493):

1. **Object keys** are sorted lexicographically by their UTF-8 byte
   representation (not by Unicode code point — in practice these are
   identical for ASCII keys used in this protocol).
2. **No insignificant whitespace** — no spaces after `:` or `,`, no
   newlines or indentation.
3. **Duplicate object member names MUST be rejected.** Per RFC 7493
   (I-JSON) and RFC 8259, duplicate names produce unpredictable parsing
   behaviour. Implementations MUST NOT produce duplicate keys, and
   MUST reject inputs that contain duplicate keys at any nesting level.
4. **Numbers** use the shortest decimal representation with no trailing
   zeroes (e.g., `1` not `1.0`, `0` not `0.0`). No leading zeroes. No
   `+` prefix. Negative zero is serialized as `0`.
5. **Strings** use `\uXXXX` escaping only for control characters
   (U+0000–U+001F). Printable characters including non-ASCII Unicode
   are serialized as literal UTF-8, not escaped. The mandatory JSON
   escapes (`\"`, `\\`, `\/`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`) use the
   short form. Forward slash `/` MUST NOT be escaped.
6. **`null`**, **`true`**, **`false`** use their literal JSON forms.
   Values that are absent or not applicable MUST be omitted from the
   object entirely rather than included as `null`, unless the field
   is explicitly defined as nullable in this specification.
7. Sorting is recursive: nested objects also have their keys sorted.

Implementations MUST verify their canonical JSON output matches these
test vectors byte-for-byte before deployment:

```text
Input:  {"methods":["wallet_signTransaction","wallet_signMessage"],
         "events":["accountsChanged","chainChanged"],
         "chains":["eip155:1","eip155:137"]}
Output: {"chains":["eip155:1","eip155:137"],"events":["accountsChanged","chainChanged"],"methods":["wallet_signTransaction","wallet_signMessage"]}
SHA-256: 4da366e2aae26b47b3d90fff52410752348733350ce2525dce7d64510f571333
```

```text
Input:  null        ->  Output: null
Input:  {"name":"MyWallet"}  ->  Output: {"name":"MyWallet"}
```

#### Key Erasure

1. `shared_secret`: erase after `root_key` is derived.
2. X25519 private key: erase after `join_encryption_key` and traffic
   keys are derived.
3. `root_key`: erase after `join_encryption_key` and traffic keys are
   derived.
4. `join_encryption_key`: erase after `sealed_join` encrypt/decrypt.
5. `transcript_hash`: erase after traffic keys are derived.
6. Traffic keys: persist for channel lifetime, erase on close.
7. Sequence counters: persist for channel lifetime, erase on close.
8. Idempotency cache: erase (zero) on close.

All erasure MUST overwrite memory with zeroes before deallocation. On
platforms that support it, implementations SHOULD use memory-locking
APIs (e.g., `mlock`, `VirtualLock`, `sodium_mlock`) to prevent key
material from being swapped to disk.

On platforms where memory locking is not available (e.g., browser
JavaScript environments), implementations MUST minimize the lifetime of
key material by erasing intermediate values (steps 1–4, 5) as soon as
derivation is complete, and SHOULD use `crypto.subtle` or WebAssembly
for key operations to reduce exposure in the JavaScript heap.

If a peer detects that persisted key material (traffic keys or sequence
counters) has been corrupted or lost, it MUST NOT attempt to reconnect.
It MUST close the channel and initiate a fresh pairing, because reusing
sequence numbers or operating with incorrect keys would break AEAD
security.

### 6.3 Session Fingerprint

```text
fp_bytes    = SHA256(
  "walletpair-v1-session-fingerprint" ||
  channel_id_bytes ||
  dapp_pubkey_bytes
)[0:4]
fp_uint32   = big-endian uint32(fp_bytes)
fingerprint = fp_uint32 mod 10000    // zero-pad to 4 digits
```

Both peers compute this independently from the pairing URI (no message
exchange needed).

Display flow:

1. DApp displays fingerprint alongside QR code.
2. Wallet computes same fingerprint, displays in confirmation dialog.
3. User verifies match, confirms. Wallet sends `join`.

### 6.4 Message Encryption

After `ready.connected`, all `req`, `res`, and `evt` payloads are
encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305:

```text
nonce   = HMAC-SHA256(traffic_key, seq_bytes)[0:12]
aad     = channel_id_bytes || aad_header
sealed  = AEAD_encrypt(traffic_key, nonce, plaintext_json_utf8, aad)
envelope = base64url_no_pad(seq_bytes || ciphertext || tag)
```

AAD header (length-prefixed to prevent delimiter ambiguity):

```text
lp(s) = uint16_be(byte_length(utf8(s))) || utf8(s)

req:  aad_header = 0x01 || lp(from) || lp(id)
res:  aad_header = 0x02 || lp(from) || lp(id)
evt:  aad_header = 0x03 || lp(from) || lp(id)
```

The type byte binds `t`+`v` (bytes `0x01`-`0x03` are for protocol
version 1). `ch` is bound via `channel_id_bytes` in the AAD prefix.
`lp()` uses uint16_be length prefix (max 65535 UTF-8 bytes per field).
If any field exceeds 65535 UTF-8 bytes, the sender MUST reject the
message before encryption.

**AAD test vector:**

```text
Given:  ch = "aa" repeated 32 times (64 hex chars)
        type = req (0x01)
        from = "dGVzdA" (base64url of "test")
        id   = "req-1"

aad_header = 01                       (type byte)
           | 0006 6447567A6441       (lp("dGVzdA") = 6 bytes)
           | 0005 7265712D31         (lp("req-1") = 5 bytes)
aad = channel_id_bytes || aad_header
```

#### Sequence Numbers

`seq_bytes` is a 4-byte big-endian counter. Each peer maintains its own
send counter starting at 0, incrementing by 1 per `sealed` message.

The receiver tracks the highest accepted sequence number (initially -1).
A message MUST be rejected if its sequence number is not strictly greater
than the last accepted value. Gaps are valid (expected after reconnect).

Sequence counters persist across reconnects and MUST NEVER be reset.

If a send counter reaches `2^31` (2,147,483,648), the peer MUST close
with reason `normal` and require fresh pairing.

### 6.5 Encrypted Join (sealed_join)

The wallet encrypts capabilities and metadata in `body.sealed_join`:

```text
join_plaintext = canonical_json({"capabilities": {...}, "meta": {...}})
join_nonce     = random_96_bits()
join_aad       = channel_id_bytes || 0x04
sealed_join    = AEAD_encrypt(join_encryption_key, join_nonce,
                              join_plaintext, join_aad)
envelope       = base64url_no_pad(join_nonce || ciphertext || tag)
```

- Nonce: fresh random 96-bit per encryption. MUST NOT reuse.
- AAD type byte `0x04` is reserved for `sealed_join`.
- Minimum decoded envelope length: 12 + 16 bytes.
- On retry: MUST use fresh nonce, MUST NOT change capabilities or
  metadata.

DApp processing:

- Compute `shared_secret`, `root_key`, `join_encryption_key` from
  wallet's `from` key.
- Parse first 12 bytes as nonce, decrypt remainder.
- Decryption failure -> close with `decryption_failed`.
- Decryption success proves that the sender controls the private key
  corresponding to `from` and used the dApp public key from the pairing
  URI. It does **not** prove that the sender is the intended user's
  wallet; a malicious relay can create its own wallet key pair and cause
  a denial-of-service or connect the dApp to an attacker-controlled
  wallet identity.
- Use decrypted capabilities and meta for transcript hash and traffic
  key derivation.

## 7. Capability Negotiation

The wallet declares its granted session scope inside `sealed_join`:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "methods": ["wallet_signTransaction", "wallet_signMessage"],
    "events": ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"],
    "chains": ["eip155:1", "eip155:137"]
  },
  "meta": {
    "name": "MyWallet",
    "description": "A multi-chain wallet",
    "url": "https://mywallet.app",
    "icon": "https://mywallet.app/icon.png"
  }
}
```

**`capabilities` fields** (all required, empty array = none):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `methods` | string[] | Methods authorized for this session. |
| `events` | string[] | Event types the wallet may push. |
| `chains` | string[] | CAIP-2 chains authorized for this session. |

**`version` field** (optional, inside `capabilities`):

```json
{ "version": { "evm": 1 } }
```

Maps sub-protocol namespace to integer version. If absent, assume
version 1 for all declared namespaces.

**Wallet `meta` fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Wallet display name. |
| `description` | no | Short description. |
| `url` | no | Wallet website URL. |
| `icon` | no | Wallet icon URL. If present, MUST be `https:`. |

Only `name` is required. DApp implementations SHOULD display
whichever fields are present and gracefully handle missing optional
fields.

### 7.1 Scope Enforcement

The pairing URI `methods` and `chains` declare the dApp's minimum
requirements. The wallet's `capabilities` declares the granted scope.

**Wallet side:**

- MUST check it can satisfy dApp's requirements from the pairing URI.
- SHOULD warn user if it cannot satisfy a required method or chain.
- MAY grant additional methods/chains beyond what was requested.
- MUST display granted scope for user confirmation before `join`.
- If pairing URI omits `methods`/`chains`, MUST warn user that the
  dApp did not declare intent.

**DApp side:**

- MUST check if granted capabilities satisfy its requirements. If
  not, SHOULD close with `unsupported_capability`.
- MUST adapt to granted capabilities (e.g., fall back to sign-only
  if `wallet_sendTransaction` not granted).
- MUST NOT call methods not in `capabilities.methods`.

**Runtime enforcement (wallet):**

1. Reject `req` with method not in `capabilities.methods` ->
   `unsupported_method`.
2. Reject requests targeting chain not in `capabilities.chains` ->
   `unsupported_chain`.
3. Only expose accounts authorized for this session.

Session scope changes (account additions/removals, chain changes) are
communicated via `accountsChanged` and `chainChanged` events. The wallet
MUST NOT expand the session's method scope after pairing without the
dApp initiating a new session.

Account authorization is revealed only through encrypted methods
(e.g., `wallet_getAccounts`), not in the `join` message.

## 8. Pairing Flow

### 8.1 Pairing URI

```text
walletpair:?ch=<channel-id>&pubkey=<dapp-pubkey-base64url>&relay=<relay-url-percent-encoded>&name=<dapp-name>&url=<dapp-url>&icon=<icon-url>&methods=<comma-list>&chains=<comma-list>
```

| Param | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `ch` | yes | Channel ID (hex, 64 chars). |
| `pubkey` | yes | DApp X25519 public key (base64url, no padding). |
| `relay` | conditional | WebSocket relay URL (percent-encoded). MUST be present when the relay transport is used. MUST be omitted when using a direct transport (e.g., BLE). |
| `name` | yes | DApp display name. |
| `url` | yes | DApp website URL (percent-encoded). |
| `icon` | yes | DApp icon URL (percent-encoded). MUST be `https:`. |
| `methods` | optional | Comma-separated list of methods the dApp requires. The wallet MUST display these to the user during pairing and MUST check that it can satisfy them (see Section 7.1). The wallet MAY grant additional methods beyond this list. |
| `chains` | optional | Comma-separated list of CAIP-2 chains the dApp requires. The wallet MUST display these to the user during pairing and MUST check that it can satisfy them (see Section 7.1). The wallet MAY grant additional chains beyond this list. |

The pairing URI MUST be delivered through a channel where a network
attacker or relay cannot substitute the content:

| Delivery method | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| QR code (optical scan) | **REQUIRED** support. |
| Deep link / URL scheme | **MUST NOT** be sole pairing mechanism. |
| Copy-paste | **MUST NOT** be sole pairing mechanism. |

Wallets MUST support QR code scanning as the primary pairing method.
Wallets MUST NOT offer deep link or copy-paste as the only pairing
option. If a wallet supports deep link pairing as a convenience
mechanism (e.g., same-device dApp-to-wallet), it MUST display a
prominent security warning: "This connection was not established via
secure out-of-band channel. A malicious app on this device could
intercept the connection. For high-value transactions, use QR code
pairing from a separate device."

Wallets that offer deep link convenience pairing SHOULD restrict
deep-link sessions to read-only methods (e.g., `wallet_getAccounts`)
by default.

DApps MUST display a QR code as the primary pairing interface. DApps
MUST display the session fingerprint (Section 6.3) alongside the QR
code so the wallet user can verify the connection. DApps MAY
additionally offer deep links but MUST label them as "Less secure —
same device only."

If the relay becomes unavailable, peers reconnect to the same relay
(Section 13). To switch to a different relay, initiate a fresh pairing.

### 8.2 Pairing Sequence

**Step 1: DApp creates channel.**

```json
{
  "v": 1, "t": "create",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff", "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<dapp-pubkey>",
  "body": {
    "meta": { "name": "MyDApp", "description": "...",
              "url": "https://mydapp.com",
              "icon": "https://mydapp.com/icon.png" }
  }
}
```

DApp `meta` fields: `name`, `description`, `url`, `icon` (all
required). This metadata is plaintext and visible to the relay.

Adapter replies with `ready`:
`{ "state": "waiting", "role": "dapp", "self": "<dapp-pubkey>", "remote": null, "reconnect": false }`

**Step 2: Wallet joins.**

Wallet scans QR, computes fingerprint, displays scope and fingerprint
for user confirmation. After user confirms, wallet sends:

```json
{
  "v": 1, "t": "join",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff", "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<wallet-pubkey>",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": "<base64url-encrypted>"
  }
}
```

Adapter forwards `join` to dApp and replies to wallet with
`ready.waiting`.

**Step 3: DApp accepts.**

DApp decrypts `sealed_join`. Successful decryption binds the join to the
pairing URI and to the wallet public key in `from`; it does not by
itself authenticate a real-world wallet vendor or user identity. The
dApp MAY auto-accept, but applications that need user identity MUST
verify accounts or signatures through encrypted methods after the
session connects.

```json
{
  "v": 1, "t": "accept",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff", "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<dapp-pubkey>",
  "body": { "target": "<wallet-pubkey>" }
}
```

**Step 4: Connected.**

Adapter sends `ready.connected` to both peers:
`{ "state": "connected", "role": "<role>", "self": "<own-pubkey>", "remote": "<peer-pubkey>", "reconnect": false }`

Both peers initialize send and receive sequence counters to 0. All
subsequent `req`, `res`, `evt` MUST be encrypted.

## 9. Request and Response

Rules:

1. Only the dApp sends `req`. Only the wallet sends `res`.
2. `res.id` MUST equal the matching `req.id`.
3. Each request receives exactly one response.
4. The decrypted `req.sealed` is `{ "_method": "<name>", ...params }`.
   The decrypted `res.sealed` contains `_ok` and either `_result` or
   `code`/`message`.

### 9.1 Request Idempotency

The wallet MUST cache processed requests to handle retries:

- **Cache:** Store request ID, params hash, and response for at least
  the most recent **1024** requests (LRU eviction). Wallets on
  memory-constrained devices MAY use a smaller cache (minimum 128
  entries) and MUST document the reduced cache size in their capability
  declaration. Individual cached responses MUST NOT exceed **16 KB**;
  oversized responses are flagged as uncacheable and re-processed on
  retry.
- **Params hash:** `SHA-256(plaintext_json_utf8)` of the raw decrypted
  bytes (before parsing). The dApp MUST cache and reuse the exact
  `plaintext_json_utf8` bytes when retrying a request. The dApp
  MUST NOT re-serialize params from parsed objects, as this may
  produce different key ordering or whitespace.
- **Cache hit, same params:** Return cached response, re-encrypted
  with fresh sequence number. MUST NOT replay old `sealed` bytes.
- **Cache hit, different params:** Reject with `invalid_params`.
- **Cache miss (evicted):** Process as new request.

**Broadcast idempotency** (`wallet_sendTransaction` only): Persist
broadcast tx hashes separately (keyed by `req.id`, max **256** entries,
LRU). Never re-broadcast for a cached `req.id`.

**Cache security.** The idempotency cache contains decrypted response
data. Wallet implementations MUST store the cache in memory that is not
swappable to disk, or encrypt the cache at rest using a key derived from
the session's traffic key. The cache MUST be securely erased (zeroed)
when the channel is closed. On platforms that do not support memory
locking (e.g., browser environments), implementations SHOULD minimize
cache lifetime and clear entries as soon as the dApp acknowledges
receipt.

The params hash comparison MUST use constant-time comparison.

## 10. Events

Rules:

1. Only the wallet sends `evt`.
2. Events do not require a response.
3. Event ordering follows transport order while connected.
4. No event replay guarantee after reconnect. The dApp SHOULD call a
   snapshot method (e.g., `wallet_getAccounts`) after reconnect.

## 11. Heartbeat

Either peer may send `ping`. The receiver replies with `pong`.

Heartbeats are not encrypted and do not consume sequence numbers.

Recommended: ping every 30 seconds, timeout after 60 seconds of no
pong. On timeout, treat connection as dead and begin reconnect
(Section 13).

## 12. Close and Terminate

### 12.1 Close (peer-initiated)

```json
{ "v": 1, "t": "close", "ch": "...", "ts": ...,
  "from": "<pubkey>", "body": { "reason": "normal" } }
```

### 12.2 Terminate (adapter-initiated)

```json
{ "v": 1, "t": "terminate", "ch": "...", "ts": ...,
  "from": "_adapter", "body": { "reason": "timeout" } }
```

Only the adapter sends `terminate`. Peers MUST NOT send it.

### 12.3 Reasons

| Reason | Used by | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `normal` | P | Normal close. |
| `user_rejected` | P | User rejected the wallet or closed channel. |
| `unsupported_capability` | P | Missing required chain or method. |
| `unsupported_version` | P | Unsupported `v` value. |
| `decryption_failed` | P | Could not decrypt `sealed`. |
| `channel_not_found` | A | Channel does not exist. |
| `channel_exists` | A | Channel ID already in use. |
| `already_connected` | A | Channel already has both peers. |
| `invalid_state` | P, A | Message not allowed in current state. |
| `invalid_role` | P, A | Message not allowed for sender's role. |
| `timeout` | P, A | Heartbeat, pairing, or session lifetime timeout. |
| `rate_limited` | P, A | Too many pending requests or messages. |
| `payload_too_large` | P, A | Message exceeds 64 KB. |
| `protocol_error` | P, A | Malformed or unsupported message. |

P = peer, A = adapter.

## 13. Reconnect

Reconnect reuses the same `create`/`join`/`accept` flow as initial
pairing, but both peers already hold the traffic keys and sequence
counters from the original session. The relay does not need to remember
anything -- it treats a reconnect exactly like a new channel.

Both peers persist `{ ch, relay_url, peer_public_key, traffic_keys,
sequence_counters }` across transport disconnections.

**DApp reconnects** by sending `create` with the same `ch` and `from`:

```json
{
  "v": 1, "t": "create",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff", "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<dapp-pubkey>",
  "body": {
    "meta": { "name": "MyDApp", "description": "...",
              "url": "https://mydapp.com",
              "icon": "https://mydapp.com/icon.png" }
  }
}
```

The relay creates a channel (or matches an existing one by `ch`) and
replies with `ready.waiting`.

**Wallet reconnects** by sending `join` with `sealed_join` set to
`null`:

```json
{
  "v": 1, "t": "join",
  "ch": "aabb01...eeff", "ts": 1779170000000,
  "from": "<wallet-pubkey>",
  "body": {
    "sealed_join": null
  }
}
```

On reconnect, `sealed_join` is `null` because capabilities were already
negotiated during initial pairing. The dApp already has the session
scope from the original handshake. The dApp sees `sealed_join: null`
and recognizes this as a reconnect from a known wallet (by matching
`from` against its persisted `peer_public_key`). The dApp auto-sends
`accept`.

The relay sends `ready.connected` to both peers with `reconnect: true`.

**Identity verification.** The relay does not verify peer identity -- it
is a stateless forwarder. Identity is verified end-to-end: each peer
checks that the remote `from` matches the persisted public key, and
proves possession of the corresponding private key by sending sealed
messages that the other peer can decrypt with the existing traffic keys.

**Sequence counter persistence.** Counters MUST be persisted durably
(write-ahead: persist before send). The counter MUST survive app
termination and OS-initiated process kills. If persistence is lost
(crash, corruption), the peer MUST NOT reconnect — MUST close and
re-pair.

If the platform cannot guarantee durable persistence (e.g., ephemeral
browser contexts, incognito mode), the implementation MUST NOT support
reconnect and MUST treat every transport disconnection as a terminal
channel close requiring fresh pairing.

**After reconnect:**

- Traffic keys, sequence counters, and idempotency cache persist.
  Sequence counters MUST NEVER be reset.
- Gaps in sequence numbers are expected (in-flight messages lost during
  disconnect).
- The dApp MAY retry pending requests with the same `req.id`.
- The dApp SHOULD refresh state (e.g., `wallet_getAccounts`).

**Reconnect backoff:** 1s -> 2s -> 5s -> 10s -> 30s.

```

## 15. Protocol Rules

1. A channel is created by the dApp.
2. A channel is joined by the wallet.
3. The dApp must accept the wallet before the channel is connected.
4. A channel can have at most one dApp and one wallet.
5. Only the dApp sends `req`.
6. Only the wallet sends `res` and `evt`.
7. `req`, `res`, and `evt` are valid only after `ready.connected`.
8. After `ready.connected`, payload content must be encrypted in the
   `sealed` field using the direction-specific traffic key.
9. A closed channel cannot carry more requests, responses, or events.
10. A single message must not exceed 64 KB on the wire.
11. A peer MUST NOT have more than 32 pending (unanswered) requests per
    channel. If a dApp sends a `req` that would exceed this limit, the
    wallet MUST reject it with error code `rate_limited` and message
    "Too many pending requests". The dApp MUST wait for at least one
    pending response before sending another request.
12. If a peer receives a message with an unsupported `v` value, it MUST
    reply with `close` reason `unsupported_version`. If the adapter
    detects an unsupported version, it sends `terminate` with the same
    reason.
13. Encryption sequence counters must never be reset. They persist across
    reconnects for the lifetime of the channel.
14. Each peer MUST locally verify that encrypted messages come from the
    expected remote peer public key.
15. A peer MUST reject `ready.connected` if `remote` does not match the
    peer public key used to derive the handshake transcript.
16. **Session expiry.** A channel MUST have a maximum session lifetime.
    The recommended default is 24 hours from `ready.connected`. Both
    peers MUST track the session start time and close the channel with
    reason `timeout` when the lifetime expires. After expiry, the peers
    MUST initiate a fresh pairing to re-establish a channel (reconnect
    MUST NOT be used after session expiry). The wallet SHOULD display
    the remaining session lifetime to the user and warn before expiry.
    If a peer receives a message on an expired session, it MUST respond
    with `close` reason `timeout`. The relay SHOULD also enforce session
    expiry independently and terminate channels that exceed the
    configured TTL (using `terminate` with reason `timeout`).
    Implementations MAY allow users to configure a shorter session
    lifetime but MUST NOT allow unlimited sessions.

## 16. Transport Requirements

A transport adapter MUST provide:

1. Bidirectional delivery.
2. Ordered delivery while connected.
3. Channel creation by the dApp.
4. Wallet join delivery to the dApp.
5. Generation of `ready` messages to both peers (including
   `ready.waiting` to the wallet after a valid `join`).
6. State enforcement per Section 14.
7. Role enforcement per Section 2.
8. Heartbeat timeout handling.

The adapter may be centralized or peer-to-peer.

## 17. WebSocket Relay Binding

### 17.1 Connection

```text
Endpoint:     wss://relay.example.com/v1
Subprotocol:  walletpair.v1
```

### 17.2 Relay Behavior

The relay MUST:

1. Accept WalletPair JSON over WebSocket text frames.
2. Track channel state in memory (no persistent storage required).
3. On `create`: create channel, reply `ready.waiting`.
4. On `join`: forward to dApp, reply `ready.waiting` to wallet.
5. On `accept`: send `ready.connected` to both peers.
6. Forward `req` to wallet only after `ready.connected`.
7. Forward `res`/`evt` to dApp only after `ready.connected`.
8. Reject invalid state/role transitions with `terminate`.
9. Expire channels: 5 min unpaired, 24 hours connected (recommended).

The relay MUST NOT:

1. Require authentication, registration, or API keys.
2. Inspect, log, or store `sealed` content beyond immediate delivery.

### 17.3 Rate Limiting

The relay MUST enforce rate limits to prevent abuse. The specific limits
are deployment-specific and not part of the protocol specification (see
the implementation guide for recommended values).

When a rate limit is exceeded, the relay MUST respond with `terminate`
using reason `rate_limited`. Peers that receive `rate_limited` SHOULD
back off before retrying.

## 18. Bluetooth Binding

### 18.1 Overview

In Bluetooth mode, there is no relay. The BLE stack acts as the
transport adapter. The dApp still owns the channel. Protocol messages
are identical; only the transport changes.

### 18.2 Discovery

DApp creates channel and exposes pairing URI via QR code (without
`relay` parameter). Wallet scans QR.

### 18.3 BLE GATT Service

```text
Service UUID: 0000FE70-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Channel (read):   0000FE71-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Message (write):  0000FE72-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  Message (notify): 0000FE73-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
```

Production deployments SHOULD register with Bluetooth SIG or use
fully random 128-bit UUIDs.

### 18.4 Flow

1. DApp creates `ch`. BLE adapter returns `ready.waiting`.
2. DApp exposes pairing URI via QR code.
3. Wallet scans, computes fingerprint, user verifies and confirms.
4. Wallet sends `join` with `sealed_join`.
5. BLE adapter forwards `join` to dApp, sends `ready.waiting` to
   wallet.
6. DApp verifies `sealed_join`, sends `accept`.
7. BLE adapter sends `ready.connected` to both.
8. Encrypted `req`/`res`/`evt` flow begins.

### 18.5 Message Framing

```text
[1 byte flags] [2 bytes total_length big-endian] [payload fragment]

flags:
  bit 0: 1 = first fragment
  bit 1: 1 = last fragment
  bits 2-7: reserved
```

`total_length` is meaningful only in the first fragment (max 65535).
Subsequent fragments set it to 0.

Limits:

| Constraint | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Fragment timeout | 5 seconds from first fragment |
| Max fragments per message | 256 |
| Max total length | 65535 bytes |
| Fragment payload size | negotiated_MTU - 3 (default: 20 bytes) |

Out-of-order fragments -> discard all buffered fragments.
Implementations MUST use indications (not notifications) or add
fragment-level sequencing.

### 18.6 Bluetooth Security

1. **Proximity.** Implementations MUST NOT rely on Bluetooth proximity
   as a security property — the QR code is the trust anchor for public
   key delivery, not physical distance. The wallet SHOULD display the
   dApp name prominently and require explicit user confirmation.
2. **Connection hijacking.** A nearby attacker could connect to the
   dApp's BLE service before the legitimate wallet. The dApp MUST
   enforce the one-wallet-per-channel rule (Section 15 rule 4). If a
   second device attempts to `join`, the BLE adapter MUST reject it
   with `already_connected`.
3. **Denial of service.** A nearby attacker can jam BLE frequencies or
   flood the GATT service with connections. This is inherent to any
   wireless protocol.

## 19. Security

### 19.1 Threat Model

The relay or transport may be compromised. It MUST NOT be able to:

- read request parameters, response results, or event data
- impersonate a peer
- replay messages to cause duplicate signing

### 19.2 Protections

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|-----------|
| Eavesdropping | E2E encryption (X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305). |
| Man-in-the-middle | Out-of-band key delivery (QR); session fingerprint (Section 6.3); `sealed_join` binds wallet to QR-scanned key. |
| Peer impersonation | Peer ID = X25519 public key; end-to-end AEAD verification after pairing and on reconnect. Initial wallet joins can be squatted by a relay-created key pair, which is treated as denial-of-service or connection to an attacker-controlled wallet identity, not compromise of the user's wallet keys. |
| Replay | Sequence-number nonce; reject non-increasing seq. |
| Channel hijack | Channel ID = 256-bit random. |
| Relay compromise | Relay sees only encrypted blobs and routing metadata. `_ok` status is encrypted. |

### 19.3 Rules

1. `ch` MUST be 256-bit cryptographically random.
2. `from` MUST match sender's X25519 public key.
3. Ephemeral key pairs MUST be generated per channel.
4. Reject messages with non-increasing sequence numbers.
5. Relay MUST NOT log or store `sealed` content.
6. Sequence counters MUST NEVER be reset for a given traffic key.
7. Applications MUST NOT treat initial `join` as proof of user identity.
   User identity and account ownership must be established through
   encrypted wallet methods and user-approved signatures where needed.

### 19.4 Privacy

Visible to relay: `ch`, `from`, `t`, `ts`.

Encrypted and invisible to relay:

- Capabilities and metadata (in `sealed_join`).
- Method and event names (inside `sealed`).
- Response success/failure (`_ok` inside `sealed`).

### 19.5 Terminate Message Trust

A malicious relay can terminate any session at will (by sending
`terminate` with `from` = `"_adapter"`). The relay cannot forge encrypted
messages or impersonate a peer (it lacks traffic keys), so the worst case
is denial of service. Peers SHOULD implement reconnect logic (Section 13)
to recover from relay-initiated disconnections.
