## 5. Performance Results

### Test 1: 1,000 Channels, 10 req/res each

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 0.52s |
| Channels created | 1,000 |
| Channels completed | 1,000 |
| Messages forwarded | 20,000 (10K req + 10K res) |
| Errors | 0 |
| p50 latency | 2.95ms |
| p95 latency | 6.63ms |
| p99 latency | 9.17ms |
| Throughput | ~38,500 messages/sec |

### Test 2: 10,000 Channels, 5 req/res each

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 3.95s |
| Channels created | 7,022 (2,978 hit OS port exhaustion) |
| Channels completed | 6,993 |
| Messages forwarded | 69,930 |
| Relay errors | 0 (all errors were OS-level `EADDRNOTAVAIL`) |
| p50 latency | 9.53ms |
| p95 latency | 17.73ms |
| p99 latency | 30.55ms |

### Test 3: Oversize/Near-Limit Payload

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| 65,537+ byte payload | Correctly rejected with `payload_too_large` |
| ~60,185 byte payload | Correctly forwarded |

### Memory

| State | RSS |
|-------|-----|
| After processing ~8K channels + ~90K messages | 94 MB |
| Note: Includes Prometheus registry, connection state, Tokio runtime |

### Capacity Estimate

Based on observed performance on a single-core test machine:

| Scenario | Estimated Capacity | Hardware |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Light use (< 100 concurrent channels) | Single $5/mo VPS (1 vCPU, 512MB RAM) | |
| Medium use (1,000 concurrent channels) | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM | ~40K msg/s throughput |
| Heavy use (10,000 concurrent channels) | 2-4 vCPU, 2-4GB RAM | Tune OS fd/port limits |
| Very heavy (50,000 channels) | 4-8 vCPU, 8GB RAM | Requires sharded store (see P2) |

The global `Mutex<ChannelStore>` will become the bottleneck before CPU or memory. For >10K concurrent channels under active message forwarding, consider switching to a `DashMap` or sharded approach.

## 6. Reliability Results

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 100 rapid create/close cycles | 0 channel leak (verified via metrics) |
| TTL cleanup of 10 expired channels | All removed within 3s |
| Abrupt disconnect (no close frame) | Handled gracefully, no panic |
| 50 invalid JSON flood | Server healthy after all |
| 50 concurrent channel creations | All succeed |
| Graceful shutdown with 5 connected channels | All peers notified |
| Metrics during activity | Always accessible |

## 7. Issues Found

### P0 — Critical

**No P0 issues found.**

The relay has no panics in production paths, no data cross-contamination between channels, no channel takeover vulnerabilities, and no unbounded resource growth.

### P1 — Important

#### Issue #1: Reconnect in PendingAccept State May Send Wrong Ready

**File:** [relay.rs:509-510](src/relay.rs#L509-L510)

**Code:**
```rust
let was_connected =
    channel.state == ChannelState::Connected || channel.state == ChannelState::PendingAccept;
```

**Problem:** If a dApp disconnects during `PendingAccept` (wallet joined, accept not sent) and reconnects while the wallet is still connected, the relay sends `ready.connected` to the dApp. But the accept step hasn't happened — the user never confirmed pairing codes. This could cause the dApp client to enter Connected state without MITM verification.

**Impact:** Depends on client implementation. If the dApp client trusts `ready.connected` from the relay without checking whether it sent `accept`, the pairing code verification step is bypassed.

**Recommendation:** On reconnect, if channel state is `PendingAccept`, always send `ready.waiting` and re-forward the cached `join` message. Alternatively, treat PendingAccept reconnect as `ready.waiting` only.

**Fix:**
```rust
let was_connected = channel.state == ChannelState::Connected;
```

#### Issue #2: Slow Consumer Not Notified With Close

**File:** [relay.rs:396-404](src/relay.rs#L396-L404)

**Code:**
```rust
if !try_send(other_sender, raw_text.to_string(), metrics) {
    // Drop the slow consumer's connection
    let channel = store.get_mut(ch).unwrap();
    match role {
        Role::DApp => channel.wallet_conn = None,
        Role::Wallet => channel.dapp_conn = None,
    }
}
```

**Problem:** When the outbound queue overflows, the relay silently drops the slow consumer's connection reference without sending a `close` message with reason. The slow consumer's write task sees the mpsc channel close but has no protocol-level notification.

**Impact:** The slow peer doesn't know why it was disconnected. It may attempt to reconnect but won't understand the cause.

**Recommendation:** Before nulling the connection, attempt to send a `close` with reason `slow_consumer` (or a protocol-defined equivalent). Since the queue is full, use a separate one-shot or direct write.

#### Issue #3: `allowed_origins` Config Has No Effect

**File:** [config.rs:21](src/config.rs#L21), [http.rs:30-37](src/http.rs#L30-L37)

**Problem:** The `allowed_origins` field is in the config and documented in `config.example.toml`, but no CORS middleware is applied to the router. The `tower-http` cors dependency is included but never used. An operator who configures `allowed_origins` expects browser origin checking, but it silently does nothing.

**Impact:** No origin-based access control. Browser-based dApps from any origin can connect.

**Recommendation:** Either wire up `tower_http::cors::CorsLayer` using the config, or remove the field and dependency to avoid false confidence.

### P2 — Moderate

#### Issue #4: Global Mutex Bottleneck

**File:** [http.rs:23](src/http.rs#L23) — `Arc<Mutex<ChannelStore>>`

Every incoming message from every connection acquires the same mutex. At moderate load (1K channels, ~40K msg/s) this works fine. At higher scale (10K+ channels with active traffic), lock contention will become the primary bottleneck.

**Recommendation:** For production at scale, consider `DashMap` or per-channel `Mutex` wrapping. For the current target (dApp-wallet pairing, typically hundreds of concurrent channels), this is acceptable.

#### Issue #5: WebSocket Subprotocol Not Strictly Required

**File:** [http.rs:48](src/http.rs#L48)

The server offers `walletpair.v1` subprotocol but doesn't reject clients that don't request it. Per the protocol spec (Section 18.2), the subprotocol should be `walletpair.v1`.

**Recommendation:** Check the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header and reject connections that don't include `walletpair.v1`.

#### Issue #6: Dummy Sender Created When dApp Disconnected During Join

**File:** [relay.rs:213-215](src/relay.rs#L213-L215)

```rust
mpsc::channel(1).0 // dummy — won't actually send
```

When the wallet joins but the dApp is already disconnected, a dummy mpsc sender is created. The `try_send` on it will fail (receiver immediately dropped). This is wasteful but not harmful.

**Recommendation:** Check `channel.dapp_conn.is_some()` before cloning and skip the forward if dApp is disconnected.

#### Issue #7: `capabilities` Stored as `serde_json::Value`

**File:** [protocol.rs:105](src/protocol.rs#L105)

The `capabilities` field in `Join` is parsed as raw `serde_json::Value` instead of a typed struct. The relay doesn't validate the required structure (`methods`, `events`, `chains` arrays).

**Impact:** Low for relay (it just forwards the raw JSON). But a malformed `capabilities` object passes through without validation.

**Recommendation:** For relay, this is acceptable (relay is a "dumb pipe"). If stricter validation is desired, add a typed `Capabilities` struct.

### P3 — Minor/Quality

#### Issue #8: `unwrap()` After Infallible Lookups in `relay.rs`

Multiple `store.get(ch).unwrap()` / `store.get_mut(ch).unwrap()` calls after confirming the channel exists. These are logically safe (the channel was just checked) but could confuse future maintainers.

**Recommendation:** Consider extracting into helper methods that return `&mut Channel` directly, or add inline comments explaining why the unwrap is safe.

#### Issue #9: Close Reason Mapping is Lossy

**File:** [relay.rs:453-457](src/relay.rs#L453-L457)

```rust
let close_reason = match reason {
    "normal" => CloseReason::Normal,
    "user_rejected" => CloseReason::UserRejected,
    _ => CloseReason::Normal,
};
```

Unknown close reasons from peers are mapped to `Normal` for metrics. This loses information. Consider adding a catch-all variant or using the original string.

#### Issue #10: No `#[must_use]` on `ProcessResult`

The `ProcessResult` enum should be `#[must_use]` to prevent accidentally ignoring rejection results.

## 8. Security and Privacy Checklist

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|

| No `unsafe` code | PASS | Verified: zero `unsafe` blocks |

## 9. Test Assets Produced

| File | Description | Long-term Value |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `tests/integration.rs` | 60 protocol conformance tests | High — regression safety net |
| `tests/reliability.rs` | 7 reliability/lifecycle tests | High — leak/crash detection |
| `tools/loadtest/` | Standalone load test binary | High — repeatable perf measurement |
| `scripts/loadtest.sh` | One-command load test runner | Medium — CI/CD integration |
| `scripts/soak.sh` | Multi-round soak test runner | Medium — pre-release validation |

## 10. Remaining Risks Requiring Human Decision

1. **Issue #1 (reconnect in PendingAccept)** — Severity depends on whether the dApp client independently tracks the accept step. If the client always checks its own state machine before proceeding, the relay sending `ready.connected` prematurely is benign. If the client trusts the relay, it's a security issue. **Needs dApp client team input.**

2. **Global Mutex scalability** — Acceptable for the stated use case (pairing service, hundreds of concurrent channels). If the target grows to 10K+ concurrent channels with heavy message traffic, this needs redesign.

3. **CORS (Issue #3)** — If the relay is meant to be accessed from browser dApps, origin checking matters. If it's always behind a reverse proxy that handles CORS, the config field should be removed to avoid confusion.

4. **Subprotocol strictness** — Some WebSocket libraries don't send subprotocol headers. Enforcing `walletpair.v1` would break those clients. Decide based on ecosystem needs.

## 11. Production Readiness Assessment

### Strengths
- Clean, well-structured Rust code (~850 lines excluding tests)
- Comprehensive protocol coverage with 101 passing tests
- No `unsafe`, no panics in production paths
- Good metrics instrumentation (Prometheus)
- Configurable limits (channels, connections, queue, TTL)
- Graceful shutdown with peer notification
- No persistent storage needed — ephemeral by design
- Performance: 38K+ msg/s on a single core, sub-10ms p95

### Recommendation

**Conditional YES for production trial**, with the following prerequisites:

1. **Must fix before production:**
   - Issue #1: Change reconnect logic to not send `ready.connected` for PendingAccept state
   - Issue #3: Either implement CORS or remove the `allowed_origins` config field

2. **Should fix soon after launch:**
   - Issue #2: Send close reason to slow consumers
   - Issue #5: Consider subprotocol validation

3. **Monitor in production:**
   - Mutex contention (via p99 latency trending)
   - Channel leak (via `walletpair_active_channels` metric)
   - Memory growth over days (via RSS monitoring)

### Hardware Sizing

| Users | Concurrent Channels | Recommended | Monthly Cost |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| < 500 | < 100 | 1 vCPU, 512MB | ~$5 |
| 500-5,000 | 100-1,000 | 1 vCPU, 1GB | ~$10 |
| 5,000-50,000 | 1,000-10,000 | 2 vCPU, 2GB | ~$20-40 |
| 50,000+ | 10,000+ | Needs sharded redesign | — |
